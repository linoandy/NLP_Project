many
portable
consumer
electronics
contain
proprietary
,
often
lithium

batteries
.
production
of
these
batteries
is
usually
stopped
at
around
the
same
time
the
product
is
discontinued
,
therefore
rendering
the
product
worthless
once
the
batteries

some
harm
reductionists
advocate
the
availability
of
the
synthetic
drug
methadone
(
or
,
more
recently
,
of
buprenorphine
)
for
users
who
are
dependent
on
opioids
(
e.g.
heroin
,
codeine
)
.
methadone
does
not
cause
a
strong
euphoria
in
the
user
but
reduces
or
eliminates
cravings
and
the
symptoms
of
opioid
withdrawal
.
therefore
,
harm
reductionists
maintain
,
methadone
should
be
made
widely
available
to
people
,
temporarily
or
permanently
,
to
promote
the
transition
to
a
fulfilling
and
healthy
lifestyle
.
critics
of
methadone
treatment
claim
that
this
is
merely
a
substitution
of
one
addiction
for
another
,
or
that
methadone
treatment
does
not
work
.
there
is
an
international
literature
to
show
that
methadone
programmes
can
help
opioid
users
stabilise
their
lifestyles
by
obtaining
a
legal
,
regulated
substitute
drug
.
this
could
potentially
help
them
look
after
themselves
,
their
families
,
and
re
-
enter
the
work
force
or
pursue
further
education
.
these
are
the
building
blocks
for
regaining
dignity
and
self
esteem
and
are
imperative
for
those
who
want
to
become
contributing
members
of
society
.
harm
reduction
is
a
flexible
philosophy
that
stresses
understanding
of
the
needs
of
the
drug
user
,
and
responding
to
these
needs
in
a
way
as
flexible
and
realistic
as
the
local
laws
allow
,
working
at
the
pace
-
and
to
achieve
the
goals
-
that
the
person
wants
.
however
,
for
those
drug
users
who
want
to
change
their
life
,
substitute
medication
should
be
complemented
by
psychological
and
practical
support
,
enabling
the
person
to
reach
their
stated
goals
.
in
the
uk
prescribing
methadone
is
seen
as
a
way
of
reducing
drug
related
-
crime
-
the
provision
of
substitute
medication
removes
the
need
to
buy
drugs
through
the
underground

many
creationists
(
for
example
henry
m.
morris
)
,
however
,
have
claimed
that
evolution
is
unfalsifiable
.
they
claim
that
any
fact
can
be
fit
into
the
evolutionary
framework
,
and
therefore
it
is
impossible
to
demonstrate
evolution
is
wrong
.
others
claim
evolution
is
unfalsifiable
in
large
part
because
,
like
theories
such
as
gravitation
,
evolution
is
so
widely
confirmed
,
and
so
foundational
,
that
the
likelihood
of
any
evidence
disproving
it
wholesale
(
as
opposed
to
merely
refining
it
)
has
become
increasingly
improbable
and
difficult
to
the
point
of
virtual
impossibility
.
others
claim
that
past
events
of
speciation
are
not
observable
and
repeatable
,
and
therefore
evolution
is
not
falsifiable
.
in
1976
,
popper
himself
said
that
"
darwinism
is
not
a
testable
scientific
theory
but
a
metaphysical
research
programme
"
.
however
,
popper
later
recanted
,
stating
that
that
natural
selection
is
falsifiable
and
offered
a
more
nuanced
view
of
its
status
:
many
accounts
,
including
muslim
accounts
,
and
some
accounts
written
by
academic
historians
,
stress
the
power
and
importance
of
the
pre
-
islamic
mecca
.
they
depict
it
as
a
city
grown
rich
on
the
proceeds
of
the
spice
trade
.
crone
believes
that
this
is
an
exaggeration
and
that
mecca
may
only
have
been
an
outpost
trading
with
nomads
for
leather
,
cloth
,
and
camel
butter
.
crone
argues
that
if
mecca
had
been
a
well
-
known
center
of
trade
,
it
would
have
been
mentioned
by
later
authors
such
as
procopius
,
nonnosus
,
and
the
syrian
church
chroniclers
writing
in
syriac
.
however
,

a

a

the
productivity
of
such
a
forest
,
in
terms
of
how
much
new
growth
it
produces
,
exceeds
that
of
the
most
productive
wheat
field
.
it
is
in
this
observation
—
of
how
much
more
productive
a
wood
may
be
on
far
less
fertilizer
input
—
that
the
potential
productivity
of
a
permaculture
design
is
modelled
.
the
many
connections
in

contribute
together
to
a
proliferation

some
have
attempted
to
construct
an
"

theory
"
defense

for
example
the

john
finnis
argues
that
human
rights
are
justifiable
on
the
grounds
of
their
instrumental
value
in
creating
the
necessary
conditions
for
human
well
-
being
.
some
interest
-
theorists
also
justify
the
duty
to
respect
the
rights
of
other
individuals
on
grounds
of
self
-
interest
(
rather
than
altruism
or
benevolence
)
.
reciprocal
recognition
and
respect
of
rights
ensures
that
one
's
own
will
be
protected
.
it
is
also
an
offence
under
section
58
of
the
terrorism
act
2000
to
take
a
photograph
of
a
kind
likely
to
be
useful
to
a
person
committing
or
preparing
an
act
of
terrorism
,
or
possessing
such
a
photograph
.
this
offence
(
and
possibly
,
but
not
necessarily
the
s.58a
offence
)
covers
only
a
photograph
as
described
in
s.2(3)(b
)
of
the
terrorism
act
2006
.
as
such
,
it
must
be
of
a
kind
likely
to
provide
practical
assistance
to
a
person
committing
or
preparing
an
act
of
terrorism
.
the
defence
may
prove
a
reasonable
excuse
simply
by
showing
that
the
photograph
is
possessed
for
a
purpose
other
than
to
assist
in
the
commission
or
preparation
of
an
act
of
terrorism
,
even
if
the
purpose
of
possession
is
otherwise
unlawful

oil
spills
in

occur
due
to
a
number
of
causes
which
include
:
corrosion
of

(
accounts
for
50
%
of

%

by

(

and

)
a
reason
that
corrosion
accounts
for
such
a
high
percentage
of
all
spills
is
that
as
a
result
of
the
small
size
of
the
oilfields
in
the
niger
delta
,
there
is
an
extensive
network
of
pipelines
between

,
as
well
as
numerous
small
networks
of
flowlines—the
narrow
diameter
pipes

of

was
a
novelty
track
which
twisted
the
common
complaint
of

keeping

faithful
.
the
twist
was
that
her

"

,
initially
just
to

radio

it
also
began
getting
airplay
on

soon
gained

the
famous
choral
finale
is
beethoven
's
musical
representation
of

brotherhood
and
has
been
characterized
by
charles

as
a
symphony
within

it
contains
four
movements
played
without

this
"

follows
the

overall
pattern
as
the
ninth
symphony
as
a
whole
.
the
scheme
is
as
follows
:
by
giving
classes
to
children
in
his
own
house
,
building
a
little
church
and
organizing
spiritual
activities
he
brought
many
people
back
to
the
catholic
faith
.
after
the
death
of
the
duke
(
1830
)
he
went
to
live
in
vienna
,
where
he
was
the
only
jesuit
for
many
years
.
his
powerful
sermons
gave
him
fame
and
jan
roothaan
,
the
superior
general
,
often
asked
him
to
negotiate
on
his
behalf
the
foundation
of
jesuit
schools
:
graz
,
innsbruck
,
linz
.
after
teaching
for
a
few
years
canon
law
at
the
roman
college
in
rome
(
1842
)
he
was
sent
to
belgium
(

and
was
appointed
rector
of
the
jesuit
theologate
in

the

have
scenes
that

that

this

"
historically
,
this
has
been
due
to
two
causes
:
the
german
population
were
considered
,
whether
factually
or
not
,
linked
with
german
nationalist
regimes
such
as
those
of
the
nazis
or
kaiser
wilhelm
.
while
many
victims
of
these
persecutions
did
not
,
in
fact
,
have
any
connection
to
those
regimes
,
cooperation
between
german
minority
organisations
and
nazi
regime
did
occur
,
as
the
example
of
selbstschutz
shows
,
which
is
still
used
as
a
pretense
of
hostilities
against
those
who
did
not
take
part
in
such
organisations
.
after
world
war
ii
,
many
such
volksdeutsche
were
killed
or
driven
from
their
homes
in
acts
of
vengeance
,
others
in
ethnic
cleansing
of
territories
prior
to
populating
them
with
citizens
of
the
annexing
country
.
in
other
cases
(
e.g.
in
the
case
of
the
formerly
large
german
-
speaking
populations
of
russia
,
estonia
,
or
the
transylvanian
(
siebenbürgen
)
german
minority
in
rumania
and
the
balkans
)
such
persecution
was
a
crime
committed
against
innocent
communities
who
had
played
no
part
in
the
third
reich

plate
,
the
researchers
subjected
them
to
cold
,
dry
conditions
for
the
first
10
minutes
of
every
hour
.
indeed
,
many
of
the
cells
throttled
back
right
on
the
hour
in
anticipation
of
another
bout
of
cold
weather
.
when
conditions
stayed
stable
for
a
while

the

gave

they
resumed

there
can
be
little

that
the
pisidians

pamphylians
were
the

people

the
distinction
between
the
two
seems
to
have
been
established
at

early
period

enumerates
the
pamphylians
among

mentions
them
both
,
correctly
including
the
one
among
the
nations
on

interior
,
the
other
among
those
of
the
coast
.
pamphylia
early
received
colonies
from
greece

other
lands
,
and
from
this
cause
,
combined
with
the
greater
fertility
of
their
territory
,
became
more
civilized
than
its
neighbor
in
the
interior

pisidia
remained
a
wild

mountainous
region

the
most
difficult
for

photobiotin
is
used
in
many
biology
laboratories
for
patterning
proteins

other
species

stimulate
photobiotin
to
attach
various
surfaces
,
where
scientists
can
visualize
the

of
the

they
are
looking

for
example
,
at
texas

to
develop
a

using

they

speculate
the
reason
why
zoroastrians
tend

discourage

not
simply
because

prohibition

from
perceived
tradition

not

accept
converts
,
some
followers
of
the
religion
see
reproduction
as
essential
to
maintain
the
the
community
.
a
homosexual
couple
can
not
reproduce
sexually
,
whereas
a
heterosexual
couple
can
.
some
followers
suggest
that
homosexuality
should
be
discouraged
as
celibacy
is
.
however
,
few
zoroastrian
communities
exclude
members
on
the
grounds
that
they
may
be
,
or
are
,
homosexual

advocates
the

among

they

is
based

on

with
emphasis

,

the

that

military
aid
to
turkey
-
which
is
usually
a
pretty
good
index
of
policy
-
turkey
was
of
course
a
strategic
ally
so
it
always
had
a
fairly
high
level
of
military
aid
.
the
peak
year
was
1997
.
in
fact
in
the
single
year
1997
,
us
military
aid
to
turkey
was
greater
than
in
the
entire
period
of
1950
to
1983
when
there
were
allegedly
cold
war
issues
.
the
end
result
was
pretty
awesome
:
tens
of
thousands
of
people
killed
,
two
to
three
million
refugees
,
massive
ethnic
cleansing
with
some
3500
villages
destroyed
-
about
seven
times
kosovo
under
nato
bombing
,
and
there
's
nobody
bombing
in
this
case
,
except
for
the
turkish
air
forces
using
planes
that
clinton
sent
to
them
with
the
certain
knowledge
that
that
's
how
they
would
be
used
.
”
in
the
same
way
that
people
are
either
registered
as
urban
or
rural
,
land
in
china
is
zoned
as
either
rural
or
urban
.
in
urban
areas
people
can
easily
sell
their
land
and
buildings
,
or
mortgage
them
to
borrow
.
the
fact
that
many
peasants
can
not
earn
a
decent
living
as
farmers
is
a
signal
that
their
labor
is
more
useful
in
urban
employment
,
hence
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
people
who
have
migrated
.
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
it
is
efficient
to
alienate
some
of
the
land
out
of
agriculture
for
urban
use
.
immunodeficiency
disorders
(
representing
an
underactive
immune
system
)
have
been
reported
.
as
early
as
1989
,
a
study
was
published
in
australia
that
documented
a
loss
of
immunological
integrity
in
one
hundred
cfs
sufferers
.
the
authors
reported
finding
disordered
ratios
of
t
-
cell
subsets
and
reduced
levels
of
immunoglobulins
specifically
igg
1
and
igg
3
;
these
findings
corresponded
with
similar
findings
in
the
u.s.
among
leading
researchers
.
most
strikingly
,
using
the
french
multitest
to
measure
the
body
's
response
to
a
variety
of
antigens
,
the
australian
group
found
that
33
%
of
the
subjects
were
hypoallergic
,
meaning
they
had
a
reduced
immune
response
,
while
an
additional
55
%
were
completely
anergic
,
meaning
they
had
no
immune
response
at
all
.
some
theories
propose
that
an
infection
with
one
of
the
below
-
listed
disease
agents
somehow
leads
to
immune
dysfunction
and
chronic
fatigue
in
cases
of
cfs.
this
is
partly
supported
by
test
results
indicating
lowered
or
changed
immune
responses
in
some
patients
,
as
well
as
elevated
levels
of
infectious
agents
in
some

to

the
name

in

,
traditional
in

and
especially
popular
in
the
basque
country

originating
in
the

country
,
they
are
usually
eaten
in
bars
or
taverns
as
a
small
snack
while
hanging
out
with
friends
or
relatives
;
thus
,
they
have
a
strong
socializing
component
,
and
they
are
usually
regarded
as
a
cornerstone
of
basque
culture
and
society
.
they
are
related
to
tapas
,
the
main
difference
being
that
pinchos
are
ordered
and
eaten
individually
,
whilst
tapas
are
usually
a
small
portion
of
food
to
be
shared
.
in
addition
,
tapas
are
served
on
a
small
dish
,
whist
pinchos
are
generally
arranged
on
bread
slices

a
new
golden
era
of
architecture
took
off
,
with
various
projects
and
young
khmer
architects
,
often
educated
in
france
,
given
opportunities
to
design
and
construct
.
this
new
movement
was
called
"
new
khmer
architecture
"
and
was
often
characterised
by
a
fusion
of
bauhaus
,
european
post

modern
architecture
,
and
traditional
elements
from

the
inherent
low

of

is
because
the

the
"
mechanics
"
of
political
verse
is
rather
straightforward
:
the
verse
has
a
more
or
less
strict
form
and
deviations
from
it
are
usually
incidental
,
or
the
exception
than
the
rule
.
the
structure
of
each
verse
follows
closely
that
convention
:
in
the
first
part
of
each
verse
(
the
first
eight
syllables
)
the
main
theme
of
the
verse
is
introduced
,
in
the
"
main
clause
"
of
the
verse
.
that
it
could
be
a
statement
,
part
of
a
dialogue
,
or
a
depiction
of
some
action
.
either
by
been
explained
,
or
completed
,
or
supplemented
,
or
quite
often
the
theme
of
the
main
clause
is
amplified
by
been
repeated
or
restated
in
other
words
.
political
verses
are
usually
,
but
not
exclusively
,
organized
in
pairs
(
thus
forming
“
stanzas
”
of
two
lines
,
known
as
distichs
or
couplets
)
.
the
question
whether
popular
culture
or
mass
culture
is
inherently
conservative
,
or
whether
it
can
be
used
in
a
subversive
strategy
as
well
,
is
equally
hotly
debated
.
it
seems
widely
accepted
that
popular
culture
forms
can
function
at
any
moment
as
anti
-
cultures
.
"
bad
taste
"
products
such
as
pornography
and
horror
fiction
,
says
for
instance
andrew
ross
(
1989:231
)
,
draw
their
popular
appeal
precisely
from
their
expressions
of
disrespect
for
the
imposed
lessons
of
educated
taste
.
they
are
expressions
of
social
resentment
on
the
part
of
groups
which
have
been
subordinated
and
excluded
by
today
's
"
civilized
society
"
.
the
term
is
often
used
pejoratively
,
as
a
way
of
dismissing
such
inputs
as
being
specially
designed
to
break
a
routine
that
is
otherwise
sound
in
practice
(
compare
with
'
byzantine
'
)
.
on
the
other
hand
,
awareness
of
pathological
inputs
is
important
as
they
can
be
exploited
to
mount
a
denial
-
of
-
service
attack
on
a
computer
system
.
also
,
the
term
in
this
sense
is
a
matter
of
subjective
judgment
as
with
its
other
senses
.
given
enough
run
time
,
a
sufficiently
large
and
diverse
user
community
,
or
other
factors
,
an
input
which
may
be
dismissed
as
pathological
could
in
fact
occur
(
as
seen
in
the
first
test
flight
of
the
ariane
5
)
.
limitations
to
the
widespread
use
of
pet
arise
from
the
high
costs
of
cyclotrons
needed
to
produce
the
short
-
lived
radionuclides
for
pet
scanning
and
the
need
for
specially
adapted
on
-
site
chemical
synthesis
apparatus
to
produce
the
radiopharmaceuticals
.
few
hospitals
and
universities
are
capable
of
maintaining
such
systems
,
and
most
clinical
pet
is
supported
by
third
-
party
suppliers
of
radiotracers
which
can
supply
many
sites
simultaneously
.
this
limitation
restricts
clinical
pet
primarily
to
the
use
of
tracers
labelled
with
f-18
,
which
has
a
half
life
of
110
minutes
and
can
be
transported
a
reasonable
distance
before
use
,
or
to
rubidium-82
,
which
can
be
created
in
a
portable
generator
and
is
used
for
myocardial
perfusion
studies
.
nevertheless
,
in
recent
years
a
few
on
-
site
cyclotrons
with
integrated
shielding
and
hot
labs
have
begun
to
accompany
pet
units
to
remote
hospitals
.
he
and
some
others

in

this
led
rabbitte
,
eamon
gilmore
and
others
to
earn
the
nickname
"
the

"
.
in
1992
rabbitte
played
a
prominent
role
with
proinsias
de
rossa
in
an
attempt
to
jettison
some
of
its
more
hard
left
positions
.
like
jews
,
the
earliest
muslims
prayed
facing
jerusalem
.
according
to
islamic
tradition
,
when
muhammad
was
praying
in
the
al
-
qiblatain
mosque
(
in
medina
)
,
he
was
ordered
by
god
to
change
the
qibla
direction
from
jerusalem
to
mecca
and
the
kaaba
.
various
theories
are
advanced
as
to
the
reason
for
the
change
,
and
most
historians
find
it
was
the
reluctance
of
the
jews
of
medina
to
convert
to
his
religion
that
prompted
the
move
.
these
will
describe
the
overall
system
load
over
a
specified
time
period
,
defining
how
many
of
each
type
of
business
transaction
will
be
executed
per
unit
of
time
.
for
example
:
1200

,
300
of

b
,
3300
of
transaction
c
,
etc
.
for

;
then
in

so
many
executions
of
a
,
b
,
c
etc
.
,
in
hour
2
so
many
transaction
executions
,
and
so
on
.
the
information
is
often
formatted
in
a
tabular
form
for
clarity
.
finally
,
the
transactions
may
be
classified
as
to
general
type
,
normally
being
user
interaction
,
report
generation
,
and
batch
processing
.
yasser
arafat
,
shimon
peres
,
and
yitzhak
rabin
were
winners
of
the
1994
nobel
peace
prize
.
arafat
was
regarded
by
critics
as
a
terrorist
leader
for
many
years
.
kare
kristiansen
,
a
norwegian
member
of
the
nobel
committee
,
resigned
in
1994
in
protest
at
the
awarding
of
a
nobel
peace
prize
to
yasser
arafat
,
whom
he
labeled
a
"
terrorist
"
.
rabin
,
while
in
the
israeli
military
,
had
ordered
the
expulsion
of
arabs
,
from
areas
captured
by
israel
during
the
1948

he
had
also
been

a
scenario
of
general
ecological
change
-
exacerbated
by
the
beginning
ice
age
and
changes
in
ocean
currents
due
to
plate
tectonic
shifts
(
e.g.
the
emergence
of
the
antarctic
circumpolar
current
or
the
closing
of
the
isthmus
of
panama
)
-
is
more
likely
,
with
the
pseudotooth
birds
as
remnants
of
the
world
's
paleogene
fauna
ultimately
failing
to
adapt
.
in
that
respect
it
may
be
significant
that
some
lineages
of
cetaceans
,
like
the
primitive
dolphins
of
the
kentriodontidae
or
the
shark
-
toothed
whales
(
squalodontoidea
)
,
flourished
contemporary
with
the
pelagornithidae
and
became
extinct
at
about
the
same
time
.
also
,
the
modern
diversity
of
pinniped
and
cetacean
genera
evolved
largely
around
the
mio
-
pliocene
boundary
,
suggesting
that
many
ecological
niches
emerged
or
became
vacant
.
in
that
respect
,
it
is
conspicuous
that
the
older
pseudotooth
birds
are
typically
found
in
the
same
deposits
as
plotopterids
and
penguins
,
while
younger
forms
were
sympatric
with
auks
,
albatrosses
,
penguins
and
procellariidae
-
which
,
however
,
underwent
an
adaptive
radiation
of
considerable
extent
coincident
(
and
probably
caused
by
)
with
the
final
demise
of
the
paleogene
-
type
trophic
web
.
in
original
performances
of
'
a
midsummer
night
's
dream
'
,
the
actor
who
played
egeus
and
the
actor
who
played
philostrate
were
probably
one
and
the
same
.
in
act
v
,
scene
1
,
for
example
,
the
quartos
say
"
call
philostrate
"
in
several
places
where
the
1623
folio
says
"
call
egeus
"
.
howard
furness
,
editor
of
several
shakespeare
editions
,
interprets
this
a
little
differently
,
saying
that
shakespeare
may
not
have
originally
intended
both
roles
to
be
played
by
the
same
person
,
but
that
directors
combined
the
roles
to
save
money
.
in
cases
where
one
actor
was
playing
both
roles
,
egeus
'
character
would
probably
have
filled
both
roles
in
this
scene
,
absorbing
philostrate
's
lines
into
his
own
.
he
gives
a
detailed
account
of
the
problems
usually
faced
by
the
oligarchies
of
his
days
,
which
he
considered
as
significantly
more
troubled
than
the
former
system
,
that
of
timocracy
.
the
following
are
examples
of
such
problems
:
the
very
distribution
of
political
power
in
an
oligarchy
,
which
prevents
wise
and
virtuous
,
but
poor
,
men
from
influencing
public
life
,
whilst
opening
such
possibility
to
the
rich
but
incompetent
ones
;
an
oligarchy
is
invariably
divided
,
in
the
one
hand
,
between
very
rich
men
,
its
governors
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
very
poor
men
.
thus
the
poor
ones
become
either
beggars
or
thugs
imbued
with
anger
at
their
condition
and
a
revolutionary
spirit
which
threatens
the
internal
stability
of
the
state
;
an
oligarchy
will
usually
perform
poorly
in
military
campaigns
because
the
rich
men
,
who
are
few
,
will
make
a
small
army
,
and
they
are
afraid
to
give
weapons
to
the
majority
,
to
the
poor
,
due
to
fears
of
a
revolution
.
when
a
revolution
does
ensue
,
and
the
poor
ones
become
victorious
over
the
rich
,
the
former
expel
the
latter
from
the
city
,
or
kill
them
,
and
then
they
divide
their
properties
between
one
another
.
one
could
argue
that
silly
putty
is
the
most
entertaining
accident
that
has
ever
happened
.
during
world
war
ii
,
japan
invaded
rubber
producing
countries
in
order
to
cut
off
the
united
states
supply
of
rubber
.
it
was
needed
in
order
to
produce
tires
for
vehicles
,
boots
for
solders
,
gas
masks
,
rafts
,
and
even
bombers
.
to
help
combat
the
lack
of
rubber
us
citizens
were
asked
to
donate
any
rubber
around
their
house
such
as
spare
tires
,
rubber
boots
,
and
rubber
rain
coats
.
all
rubber
made
products
were
rationed
and
citizens
had
to
make
their
products
last
till
the
end
of
the
war
.
also
in
response
the
government
asked
producers
to
try
and
come
up
with
a
synthetic
rubber
compound
.
the
new
minority
government
managed
to
secure
itself
a
majority
in
a
by
-
election
and
was
dominated
overwhelmingly
by
the
always
-
smiling
self
confessed
"
media
tart
"
peter
beattie
.
a
major
controversy
broke
in
2001
on
the
eve
of
the
election
,
when
a
number
of
very
prominent
labor
party
figures
were
implicated
in
rorting
internal
preselection
and
party
ballots
.
the
subsequent
shepardson
commission
of
inquiry
was
widely
expected
to
destroy
the
government
.
beattie
immediately
undertook
a
purge
,
taking
the
opportunity
to
dispatch
several
factional
enemies
,
and
promised
a
"
cleanskin
"
approach
.
many
in
the
community
object
to
transgaming
's
business
practices
by
"
making
a
quick
buck
"
off
the
back
of
the
wine
project
,
without
contributing
anything
back
.
transgaming
obtained
the
source
to
the
original
wine

when
it
was
under
the
mit

(
non

and
this

placed
no

how
transgaming
published
their

.
transgaming
does
release
portions
of
the

however
,
it
attaches
legal

mean
that

then
in

again
in

,
enron

the
corporate

have
claimed
that

not

the
financial
misdealings

the

of

emanates
from
the
view
that

one
must
approach
them
from
several
complementary
disciplinary
directions
and
analytical
frameworks
.
in
this
regard
,
the
study
of

'
is
considered
important
because
it
both
equips
students
with
meta
-
tools
such
as
the
ability
to
reason
rigorously
and
logically
,
and
facilitates
ethical
reflection
.
the
study
of
'
politics
'
is
considered
necessary
because
it
acquaints
students
with
the
authoritative
structures
that
govern
society
and
help
solve
collective
action
problems
.
finally
,
studying
'
economics
'
is
seen
as
vital
in
the
modern
world
because
political
decisions
often
concern
economic
matters
,
and
government
decisions
are
often
influenced
by

-
during
the
1970s
bellevue
park
was
neglected
and
many
of
the
amenities
were
in
a
poor
state
of
repair
.
a
major
project
was
undertaken
to
refurbish
the
park
back
to
its
original
splendour
.
the
park
itself
has
many

through

as
well
as
affording
some
magnificent
views
of

the
movement
is
difficult
to
define
or
summarize
,
but
may
be
broadly
understood
as
a
body
of
distinct
responses
to
structuralism
(
hence
the
prefix
"
post
"
)
.
many
contributors
,
most
notably
jacques
derrida
,
michel
foucault
,
and
julia
kristeva
,
either
inverted
structuralist
principles
or
set
out
to
reject
them
outright
.
in
direct
contrast
to
the
structuralist
claim
of
an
independent
signifier
superior
to
the
signified
,
post
-
structuralism
generally
views
the
signifier
and
signified
as
inseparable
but
not
united
;
meaning
itself
inheres
to
the
play
of
difference
.
anti

,
as
a
rejection

port
forwarding
is
commonly
done
on
unix
computers
where
port
numbers
numbered
below
1024
can
only
be
accessed
by
software
running
as
the
root
user
.
running
as
root
can
be
a
security
risk
,
so
some
people
use
port
forwarding
to
redirect
incoming
traffic
from
a
low
numbered
port
to
software
listening
on
a
higher
port
.
for
example
,
a
web
server
may
be
listening
on
a
port
such
as
8080
for
traffic
redirected
from
the
restricted
port
80
.
a
port
may
be
forwarded
for
use
by
either
the
tcp
protocol
,
the
udp
protocol
,
or
both
.
using
humor
in
such
scenes
is
also
still
common
for
more
serious
films
,
as
in
the
film

,
in

is
shown
after

defeat

he
was
last
seen
previously
in

the
other
major
players
have
left
.

eschew
the

concluded

located

accept

that

our
modern
conception

based
on

hermann
minkowski

rates
of

run

einstein
's
general

as
well
as
the
redshift
of

from

indicate
that

despite
offering

good

,
traditional

ball
projectors
suffer
several
inherent
limitations

from
a
practical
point

view
,
the
low
light
levels
require
several
minutes
for
the
audience
to
"
dark
adapt
"
its
eyesight
.
finally
,
a
challenge
for
most
traditional
projectors
is
that
the
various
overlaid
projection
systems
are
incapable
of
proper
occultation
.

reasons
,

,
in

if

it
is

(
this
is
because
,
according
to
physicalism
,
'
all

are
fully
determined

the
physical

so
any

is
'

there

which
all
the
physical

are
the

as
those
of
our

but
in
which
there
are
additional
facts
.
(
for
example
,
it
is
possible
that
there
is
a
world
exactly
like
ours
in
every
physical
respect
,
but
in
it
everyone
lacks
certain
mental
states
,
namely
any
phenomenal

qualia

the
people
there
look

act
just
like
people
in

but
they
do
n't
feel
anything
;
when
one
gets

,
he

he

two

the

note
that
the
number

during

is
relatively
proportional
for
a
city

by

realizes
that

the
prosecution
used
coutts
'
behaviour
(
hiding
the
body
)
in
the
weeks
after
the
death
to
strengthen
the
case
that
coutts
had
the
intent
to
commit
murder
.
coutts
himself
claimed
that
he
thought
his
accidental
death
explanation
would
not
be
believed
,
and
he
would
be
convicted
of
murder
regardless
.
this
has
turned
out
to
be
true
,
but
in
any
case
,
the
post
-
death
behaviour
appears
to
strengthen
the
claim
that
the
death
was
unplanned
.
the
prosecution
case
was
that
coutts
,
who
visited
the
stored
body
on
a
number
of
occasions
,
showed
necrophiliac
tendencies
.
if
he
had
such
tendencies
before
the
death
,
they
may
have
been
the
necessary
motive
for
murder
.
when
interviewed
informally
by
police
investigating
ms.
longhurst
's
disappearance
,
coutts
also
repeatedly
lied
to
police
about
his
movements
,
before
going
on
holiday
with
his
partner
,
who
was
expecting
twins
.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
in
1868
,
the
supreme
court
generally
held
that
the
substantive
protections
of
the
bill
of
rights
did
not
apply
to
state
governments
.
subsequently
,
under
the
incorporation
doctrine
the
bill
of
rights
have
been
broadly
applied
to
limit
state
and
local
government
as
well
.
for
example
,
in
the
'
board
of
education
of
kiryas
joel
village
school
district
v.
grumet
'
(
1994
)
,
the
majority
of
the
court
joined
justice
david
souter
's
opinion
,
which
stated
that
"
government
should
not
prefer
one
religion
to
another
,
or
religion
to
irreligion
.
"
critics
of
this
interpretation
argue
that
it
effectively
changes
the
constitution
.
however
,
this
is
a
controversial
and
evolving
area
of
jurisprudence
.
the
extreme
force
over
teeth
can
occur
during
some
situations
,
as
a
reflex
of
protection
.
it
is
a
protective
reflex
,
although
it
is
considered
parafunctional
:
over
clenching
.
when
this
kind
of
reflex
acts
it
is
very
important
to
have
a
good
memory
of
"
best
bite
"
position
.
if
not
,
during
process
,
some
tooth
may
be
improperly
overloaded
causing
fractures
.
however
,
there
is
some
speculation
among
fans
that
she
had
faked
her
death
in
order
to
get
out
of
the
industry
completely
.
the
audiencia
wished
to
drive
a
number
of
japanese
from
the
city
,
but
when
this
was
attempted
and
force
employed
,
the
japanese
resisted
,
and
the
matter
came
to
such
a
pass
that
they
took
arms
to
oppose
it
.
the
affair
assumed
threatening
proportions
,
and
some
on
each
side
wished
to
give
battle
.
however
,
battle
was
postponed
by
various
means
until
,
through
the
efforts
of
certain
religious
,
the
japanese
were
quieted
.
afterward
as
many
as
possible
were
embarked
in
vessels
,
much
against
their
will
.
stannard
's
claim
of
100
million
deaths
has
been
disputed
because
he
does
not
cite
any
demographic
data
to
support
this
number
,
and
because
he
makes
no
distinction
between
death
from
violence
and
death
from
disease
.
noble
david
cook
,
latin
americanist
and
history
professor
at
florida
international
university
,
considers
books
such
as
stannard
's
a
number
of
which
were
released
around
the
year
1992
to
coincide
with
the
500th
anniversary
of
the
columbus
voyage
to
america
to
be
an
unproductive
return
to
black
legend
-
type
explanations
for
depopulation
.
in
response
to
stannard
's
figure
,
political
scientist
r.
j.
rummel
has
instead
estimated
that
over
the
centuries
of
european
colonization
about
2
million
to
15
million
american
indigenous
people
were
the
victims
of
what
he
calls
'
democide
.
'
rummel
's
estimate
is
presumably
not
a
single
democide
,
but
a
total
of
multiple
democides
,
since
there
were
many
different
governments
involved
.
shi`a
islam
is
the
second
largest
denomination
of
islam
.
shi`a
muslims
believe
that
similar
to
the
appointment
of
prophets
,
imams
after
muhammad
are
also
chosen
by
god
.
according
to
shi`as
,
ali
was
chosen
by
allah
and
thus
appointed
by
muhammad
to
be
the
direct
successor
and
leader
of
the
muslim
community
.
they
regard
him
as
the
first
shi'a
imam
,
which
continued
as
a
hereditary
position
through
fatima
and
ali
's
descendants
.
the
largest
group
of
shi`a
muslims
believe
in
a
total
of
twelve
imams
.
the
twelfth
imam
is
believed
to
be
in
occultation
,
and
will
appear
again
just
before
the
end
times
.
the
shi`a
hadiths
include
the
sayings
of
the
imams
.
many
muslims
criticise
the
shia
for
certain
beliefs
and
practices
,
including
practices
such
as
the
mätam
.
in
this
kind
of
setting
the
expression
of
ecm
genes
has
the
potential
to
more
closely
resemble
that
of
the
native
expression
profile
.

as

,
and
any
mixture
of
these
three
components
.
one
such
system
has
been
developed
to
study
skin
development
and
basal
membrane
formation
between
keratinocytes
and
the
stroma
.
another
system
using
a
disorganized
hydrated
collagen
i
gel
has
been
used
to
demonstrate
that
primary
human
corneal
fibroblasts
will
eventually
invade
the
gel
and
create
a
matrix
consisting
of
collagen
type
i
and
perlecan
,
as
well
as
several
other
sulfated
matrix
glycoproteins
.
this
mimics
the
in

corneal
fibroblast
’s
developmental
program
and
response
to
injury
.
one
of
the
long
-
term
goals
of

culture
systems
is
to
engineer
tissues
that
can
be
used
as
replacements
for

with
many
types
of
disease

another
procedure
that
could
be
made

there

fact
no

concerto
of
which
so
much
of
the
solo
part
was
left
unfinished
by
the
composer
.
the
1794

edition
had
these
gaps
filled
in
,
and
most
mozart
scholars
such
as
alfred
einstein
and

have
assumed
that
the
additions
were
made
by
the
publisher
johann

einstein
is
on
record
as
finding

completion
somewhat
wanting
:
"
for
the
most
part
,
this
version
is
extremely
simple
and
not
too
offensive
,
but
at
times—for
example
,
in
the
accompaniment
of
the
larghetto
theme—it
is
very
clumsy
,
and
the
whole
solo
part
would
gain
infinitely

revision

refinement

national
loyalties
have
been
described
as
a
destructive
influence
on

human
rights
movement
because
they
deny
people
's
innately
similar
human
qualities
.
but
others
argue
that
state
sovereignty
is
paramount
,
not
least
because
it
is
often
the

slowly

surely
moves
to
the

broke
the
egg
,
then
he
or
she
was
considered
guilty
,
based
on
the
idea
that
their
nervousness
was
to
blame
.
because
salivation
was
believed
to
cease
at
times

the

left
the

in

due
to
an
intense
disagreement
over
the
direction
the
band
’s
music
had
taken
over
the
past
several
years
,
especially
the
decision
to
have
no
political
or
controversial
content
in
the
lyrics
.
first
,
it
must
be
pursued
only
as
a
means
to
some
end
,
and
not
as
an
end
in
itself
;
moreover
,
if
it
is
an
end
in
itself
,
then
it
must
be
of
comparatively
lower
value
than
one
's
other
goals
.
second
,
the
ultimate
goal
must
be
to
help
satisfy
the
desires
of
others
.
third
,
the
means
by
which
one
pursues
one
's
goal
must
not
be
egregious
or
malign
,
such
that
they
outweigh
the
value
of
the
end
;
as
(
for
instance
)
the
gassing
of
children
for
the
sake
of
future
democracy
(
russell
1938:201
)
.
this
is
explicitly
intended
as
one
possible
argument
against
utilitarianism
,
though
russell
does
not
take
it
to
be
decisive
.
fourth
,
moral
doctrines
should
aim
toward
truth
and
honesty
,
not
the
manipulation
of
others

russell

)
.
predatory
pricing
practices
may
result
in
antitrust
claims
of
monopolization
or
attempts
to
monopolize
.
businesses
with
dominant
or
substantial
market
shares
are
more
vulnerable
to
antitrust
claims
.
however
,
because
the
antitrust
laws
are
ultimately
intended
to
benefit
consumers
,
and
discounting
results
in
at
least
short
-
term
net
benefit
to
consumers
,
the
u.s.
supreme
court
has
set
high
hurdles
to
antitrust
claims
based
on
a
predatory
pricing
theory
.
if
there
is
a
likelihood
that
market
entrants
will
prevent
the
predator
from
recouping
its
investment
through
supra
competitive
pricing
,
then
there
is
no
probability
of
success
and
the
antitrust
claim
would
fail
.
in
other
words
,
when
one
compares
the
two
lists
of
conditions
side
by
side
,
one
finds
that
'
a
'
)
the
wpo
list
contains
'
some
but
not
all
'
of
the
conditions
found
on
the
spo
list
and
'
b
'
)
the
wpo
list
contains
'
no
'
conditions
'
not
found
'
on
the
spo
list
)
.
the
logical
consequence
may
be
paraphrased
in
both
of
two
ways
,
the
only
difference
being
one
of
emphasis
and
resulting
from
how
one
distributes
the
negation
:
'
a
'
)
every
allocation
that
satisfies
the
conjunction
of
the
conditions
for
spo
status
also
(
and
by
virtue
of
its
satisfying
that
conjunction
)
satisfies
the
conjunction
of
the
conditions
for
wpo
status
,
and
'
b
'
)
the
conjunction
of
conditions
for
wpo
status
disqualifies
only
a
subset
of
the
allocations
disqualified
by
the
conjunction
of
conditions
for
spo
status
.
one
may
apply
the
same
metaphor
to
describe
the
set
of
requirements
for
wpo
status
as
being
"
weaker
"
than
the
set
of
requirements
for
spo
status
.
therefore
,
the
requirements
for
wpo
status
are
not
merely
weaker
on
balance
or
weaker
according
to
the
odds
;
rather
,
one
may
describe
them
more
specifically
and
quite
fittingly
as
"
pareto
-
weaker
.

his
central
argument
on
population
is
as
follows
:
a
cancer
is
an
uncontrolled
multiplication
of
cells
;
the
population
explosion
is
an
uncontrolled
multiplication
of
people
.
treating
only
the
symptoms
of
cancer
may
make
the
victim
more
comfortable
at
first
,
but
eventually
he
dies
-
often
horribly
.
the
operation
will
demand
many
apparent
brutal
and
heartless
decisions
.
the
pain
may
be
intense
.
major
philosophical
questions
arise
as
soon
as
one
attempts
to
define
chemistry
and
what
it
studies
.
atoms
and
molecules
are
often
assumed
to
be
the
fundamental
units
of
chemical
theory
,
but
traditional
descriptions
of
molecular
structure
and
chemical
bonding
fail
to
account
for
the
properties
of
many
substances
,
including
metals
and
metal
complexes
.
for
example
,
many
rocks
exist
as
mineral
complexes
composed
of
multiple
ions
that
do
not
occur
in
fixed
proportions
or
spatial
relationships
to
one
another
.
the
cannibalistic
trait
of
the
story
goes
back
as
far
as
the
myth
of
pelops
.
the
myth
's
imagery
of
meat
pies
made
from
people
is
almost
certainly
an
allusion
to
the
finale
of
shakespeare
's
'
titus
andronicus
'
and
the
original
roman
tale
on
which
it
was
based
,
the
story
of
'
tereus
,
procne
and
philomela
'
in
ovid
's
metamorphoses
.
there
is
thought
to
have
been
a
jacobin
barber
who
cut
the
throats
of
his
customers
during
the
french
revolution
,
though
for
politics
rather
than
profit
.
likewise
,
the
15th
-
century
scottish
figure
sawney
bean
led
a
family
of
thieves
who
are
believed
to
have
feasted
on
their
victims
.
it
may
be
relevant
that
'
sweeney
'
could
be
considered
a
typically
irish
name
,
just
as
'
sawney
'
is
a
scottish
one
;
ethnic
prejudice
could
underlie
both
legends
.
despite
their
great
similarities
in
appearance
and
lifestyle
,
there
are
still
a
number
of
minor
differences
that
distinguish
phytosaurs
from
true
crocodiles
.
it
is
possible
however
that
phytosaurs
had
a
fleshy
palate
,
as
many
mesozoic
crocodiles
are
presumed
to
have
had
.
finally
,
and
most
noticeably
,
phytosaurs
had
nostrils
placed
near
or
above
the
level
of
the
eyes
,
in
contrast
to
crocodiles
where
the
nostrils
are
near
the
end
of
the
snout
.
this
adaptation
may
have
developed
to
allow
them
to
breathe
while
the
rest
of
the
body
was
submerged

these
machines
utilised
several
features
for
the
first
time
which
have
since
become
commonplace
in
machine
design
.
the
boring
operation
indented
gauging
points
in
the
wooden
blocks
which
the
clamps
of
the
later
machines
used
to
locate
the
blocks
precisely
.
this
meant
that
positioning
of
the
block
in
later
processes
ensured
accurate
location
in
relation
to
the
tool
working
on
it
.
several
of
the
machines
had
cone
clutches
.
brunel
used
detachable
tool
bits
held
in
tool
holders
very
similar
to
those

now
on

purpose
lathes
.
expanding
collet
chucks
were
used
to
locate
the
sheaves
by
gripping
the
internal
bore
,
during
certain
operations
.
two
-
jaw
gripping
chucks
were
used
on
some
machines
.
these
were
precursors
of
the
three
-
jaw
chucks
used
on
lathes
today
.
the
morticing
machines
could
be
set
to
stop
automatically
once
the
operation
was
finished
.
interchangeability
of
the
sheaves
and
pins
was
possible
,
since
they
were
not
married
to
a
particular
shell
.
the
work

flow

perhaps
best
described
as
batch

of

confusion

two

report
states
that

in
general
is
helpful
to
many
people
with
other
illnesses
;
and
while
it
is
controversial
in
regards
to
cfs
,
it
seems
to
be
most
effective
in
those
with
less

forms
but
much
less
effective
in
the
severely
affected
.
commenting
on
the
relevance
of
cbt
for

,
the
report
states
that
it
has
a
role
to
play
in
treatment
but
at
best
is
only
a
partial
answer
and
more
research
is
needed
.
a
systematic
review
on
cbt
finds
that
,
while
some
kind
of
positive
result
is
often
reported
,
the
quality
of
the
research
into
the
effects
of
cbt
is
usually
rather
low
and
the
patient
selection
is
not
random
.

note
that

state
that

publication
bias
seems

be
present

in

the
effect
of
cbt
has
been
demonstrated
up
to
five
years
after
therapy
.
a
large
evaluation
study
in
belgium
,
however
,
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
while
on
average
cbt
may
cause
patients
to
feel
somewhat
better
,
objective
measurement
shows
no
reduction
in
their
disability
.
another
recent
study
found
that
cbt
improved
self
-
reported
cognitive
impairment
but
not
actual
neuropsychological
test
performance
.
according
to
researchers
of
one
study
,
cbt
usually
aims
at
reducing
fatigue
but
can
also
reduce
pain
,

higher
pain
at
baseline
was
associated
with
a
negative

outcome

the
place
of
cbt
for

the
severely

needs
to
be
better
established

one
way
of
presenting
the
semantics
for
lp
is
to
replace
the
usual
functional
valuation
with
a
relational
one
.
lp
is
also
commonly
presented
as
a
many
-
valued
logic
with
three
truth
values
(
'
true
'
,
'
false
'
,
and
'
both
'
)
.
a
formula
must
be
assigned
'
at
least
'
one
truth
value
,
but
there
is
no
requirement
that
it
be
assigned
'
at
most
'
one
truth
value
.
the
semantic
clauses
for
negation
and
disjunction
are
given
as
follows
:
v(
eg
a,1
)
\leftrightarrow
v(a,0
)
v(
eg
a,0
)
\leftrightarrow
v(a,1
)
v(a
\lor
b,1
)
\leftrightarrow
v(a,1
)
\
or
\
v(b,1
)
v(a
\lor
b,0
)
\leftrightarrow
v(a,0
)
\
and
\
v(b,0
)
(
the
other
logical
connectives
are
defined
in
terms
of
negation
and
disjunction
as
usual
.
)
or
to
put
the
same
point
less
symbolically
:
'
not
a
'
is
true
if
and
only
if
'
a
'
is
false
'
not
a
'
is
false

if
'
a

a
or
b
'
is
false
if
and
only
if
'
a
'
is
false
and
'
b
'
is

)
logical
consequence
is
then
defined
as
truth
-
preservation
:
:
\gamma\vdash
a
if
and
only
if
a\
,
is
true
whenever
every
element
of
\gamma\
,
is
true
.
now
consider
a
valuation
v\
,
such
that
v(a,1)\
,
and
v(a,0)\
,
but
it
is
not
the
case
that
v(b,0)\,.
for
this
reason
,
proponents
of
lp
usually
advocate
expanding
the
system
to
include
a
stronger
conditional
connective
that
is
not
definable
in
terms
of
negation
and
disjunction
.

the

ranges

,
as
well
as
a
number
of
islands
.
a
few
species
are
migratory
,
but
the

the
most
telling
characteristic
of
the

is
the
long

of

of

pathological
(
acquired
)
phimosis
has
several
causes
.
lichen
sclerosus
et
atrophicus
(
thought
to
be
the
same
condition
as
balanitis
xerotica
obliterans
)
,
is
regarded
as
a
common
(
or
even
the
main
)
cause
of
pathological
phimosis
.
other
causes
may
include
:
scarring
caused
by
forcible
retraction
of
the
foreskin
,
and
balanitis
.
some
studies
found
phimosis
to
be
a
risk
factor
for
urinary
retention
and
carcinoma

.
paos
accomplish
this
removal
of
phosphate
by
accumulating
it
within
their
cells
as
polyphosphate
.
paos
are
by
no
means
the
only
bacteria
that
can
accumulate
polyphosphate
within
their
cells
and
in
fact
,
the
production
of
polyphosphate
is
a
widespread
ability
among
bacteria
.
however
,
the
paos
have
many
characteristics
that
other
organisms
that
accumulate
polyphosphate
do
not
have
,
that
make
them
amenable
to
use
in
wastewater
treatment
.
most
other
bacteria
can
not
consume
under
these
conditions
and
therefore
paos
gain
a
selective
advantage
within
the
mixed
microbial
community
present
in
the
activated
sludge
.
therefore
,
wastewater
treatment
plants
that
operate
for
enhanced
biological
phosphorus
removal
have
an
anaerobic
tank
(
where
there
is
no
nitrate
or
oxygen
present
as
external
electron
acceptor
)
prior
to
the
other
tanks
to
give
paos
preferential
access
to
the
simple
carbon
compounds
in
the
wastewater
that
is
influent
to
the
plant
.
for
want
of
a
more
accurate
common
name
,
the
family
is
often
described
as
the
'
australasian
robins
'
.
the
family
occurs
in
new
guinea
,
australia
and
numerous
pacific
islands
as
far
east
as
samoa
.
within
the
family
the
species
are
known
not
only
as
robins
but
the
flycatchers
,
and
scrub
-
robins
.
they
are
however
unrelated
to
old
world
family
muscicapidae
(
to
which
other
species
with
such
names
belong
)
,
or
the
monarch

(

)
.
one
of
the
major
technical
innovations
that
helped
to
create
the
sound
of
the
modern
piano
was
the
use
of
a
strong
iron
frame
.
the
increased
structural
integrity
of
the
iron
frame
allowed
the
use
of
thicker
,
tenser
,
and
more
numerous
strings
.
the
single
piece
cast
iron
frame
was
patented
in
1825
in
boston
by
alpheus
babcock
,
combining
the
metal
hitch
pin
plate
(
1821
,
claimed
by
broadwood
on
behalf
of
samuel
hervé
)
and
resisting
bars
(
thom
and
allen
,
1820
,
but
also
claimed
by
broadwood
and
Érard
)
.
composite
forged
metal
frames
were
preferred
by
many
european
makers
until
the
american
system
was
fully
adopted
by
the
early
20th
century
.
cognates
of
the
term
appear
in
other
languages
and
cultures
,
presumably
also
derived
from
the
portuguese
word
,
and
it
is
not
controversial
or
derogatory
in
these
contexts
.
it
is
in
widespread
use
in
melanesian
pidgin
and
creole
languages
such
as
tok
pisin
of
papua
new
guinea
,
as
the
word
for
"
child
"
(
or
just
young
,
as
in
the
phrase
'
pikinini
pik
'
,
meaning
'
piglet
'
)
.
in
surinamese
sranan
tongo
the
term
'
pikin
'
may
refer
to
'
children
'
as
well
as
to
'
small
'
or
'
little
'
.
some
of
these
words
may
be
more
directly
related
to
the
portuguese

to

simple
systems
that
clearly
separate

are
not
prone
to
systemic
risk
.
this
risk
is
more
likely
as
the
complexity
of
the
system
increases
,
because
it
becomes
more
difficult
to
see

analyze
all
the
possible
combinations
of
variables

the

,
the
more
likely
it

the
appointment
of
timberlake
in
the
department
of
biological
control
in
1924
was
motivated
by
his

ladybird
beetles

groups
of
importance
in

however
,
by
the
late
1920s
and
thereafter
,
he
focused
almost
entirely
upon
the
taxonomy
of

portuguese
king

at
harvest
time
,
gardeners
usually
dig
up
potatoes
with
a
long
-
handled
,
three
-
prong
"
grape
"
(
or
graip
)
,
i.e.
a
spading
fork
,
or
a
potato
hook
which
is
similar
to
the
graip
but
its
tines
are
at
a
90
degree
angle
to
the
handle
.
this
is
transported
up
an
apron
chain
consisting
of
steel
links
several
feet
wide
,
which
separates
some
of
the
dirt
.
the
most
complex
designs
use
vine
choppers
and
shakers
,
along
with
a
blower
system
or
"
flying
willard
"
to
separate
the
potatoes
from
the
plant
.
the
result
is
then
usually
run
past
workers
who
continue
to
sort
out
plant
material
,
stones
,
and
rotten
potatoes
before
the
potatoes
are
continuously
delivered
to
a
wagon

in
a
box
that
is
too
small
,
a
macromolecule
may
interact
with
its
own
image
in
a
neighboring
box
,
which
is
functionally
equivalent
to
a
molecule
's
"
head
"
interacting
with
its
own
"
tail
"
.
this
produces
highly
unphysical
dynamics
in
most
macromolecules
,
although
the
magnitude
of
the
consequences
and
thus
the
appropriate
box
size
relative
to
the
size
of
the
macromolecules
depends
on
the
intended
length
of
the
simulation
,
the
desired
accuracy
,
and
the
anticipated
dynamics
.
for
example
,
simulations
of
protein
folding
that
begin
from
the
native
state
may
undergo
smaller
fluctuations
and
therefore
may
not
require
as
large
a
box
as
simulations
that
begin
from
a
random
coil
conformation
.
a
common
recommendation
based
on
simulations
of
dna
is
to
require
at
least
1
nm
of
solvent
around
the
molecules
of
interest
in
every
dimension

is
provided
with
all
major
operating

,
attempts
to
convert
universally
to
the
dvorak
layout
have
not
succeeded
.
the
failure
of
the
dvorak
layout
to
displace
the
qwerty
layout
has
been
the
subject
of
some
studies
and
of
considerable
debate
.
however
,
in
considering
resistance
to
the
adoption
of
the
dvorak
layout
,
different
segments
of
the
market
(
non

typists
,
typists
,
corporations
and
manufacturers
)
differ
in
the
extent
,
nature
,
and
motivation
of
their
resistance
.
furthermore
,
the
influence
of
these
factors
on
the
different
segments
of
the
market
has
changed
over
time
,
following
changes
in
technology
and
awareness
of
dvorak
as
an
alternative
keyboard
layout
.
factors
against
adoption
of
the
dvorak
layout
have
included
the
following
:
failure
to
demonstrate
superiority
in
speed
,
economy
of
effort
,
and
accuracy
--
noting
that
the
significant
issue
here
is
the
demonstrability
.
few
studies
have
been
done
on
the
relative
efficiency
of
the
two
keyboard
layouts
,
and
those
studies
have
been
criticised
for
failing
to
adhere
to
rigorous
academic
standards
.
failure
to
achieve
the
general
population
's
awareness
that
the
dvorak
layout
existed
.
this
improved
somewhat
following
the
'
guinness
book
of
records
'
1985
publication
of
barbara
blackburn
’s
achievement
of
212
wpm
using
a
dvorak
keyboard
,
and
again
in
the
mid-1990s
when
computer
operating
systems
began
to
incorporate
the
dvorak
layout
as
an
option
.
failure
to
overcome
an
investment
in
competence
in
the
qwerty
layout
made
by
a
large
number
of
typists
and
typist
trainers
prior
to
the
general
availability
of
the
dvorak
layout
.
this
investment
has
proved
the
most
powerful
influence
up
until
the
1990s
.
typing
training
in
schools
and
secretarial
colleges
is
almost
always
done
on
the
qwerty
layout
both
because
it
conforms
with
the
expectation
of
industry
and
because
it
is
the
layout
with
which
most
teachers
or
trainers
are
already
familiar
.
many
qwerty
typists
have
retrained
themselves
to
use
the
dvorak
layout
because
the
emphasis
in
touch
typing
is
traditionally
on
speed
and
accuracy
,
and
because
dvorak
users
commonly
report
a
reduction
in
typing
-
related
injuries
such
as
carpal
-
tunnel
syndrome
.
a
reduction
in
efficiency
while
learning
the
dvorak
layout
further
impedes
its
adoption
by
typists
already
competent
with
qwerty
,
and
the
organizations
that
employ
them---although
it
has
been
claimed
that
on
average
,
typists
who
switch
to
dvorak
require
just
two
to
three
weeks
'
use
to
surpass
their
former
typing
speeds
.
failure
to
persuade
large
typewriter
manufacturers
to
produce
significant
volumes
of
typewriters
equipped
with
dvorak
layouts
.
it
would
be
sufficient
to
argue
that
the
manufacturers
were
responding
to
the
large
qwerty
user
base
,
rather
than
considering
the
plausible
but
unproven
assertion
that
manufacturers
had
a
vested
interest
in
ensuring
that
typists
could
not
type
faster
than
the
machines
could
respond
mechanically
.
converting
standard
mechanical
typewriters
to
dvorak
(
or
any
alternative
,
e.g.
international
,
layout
)
was
often
impractical
,
and
at
best
expensive
,
so
switching
to
dvorak
usually
required
a
new
,
dedicated
machine
.
a
notable
exception
was
the
popular
ibm
selectric
typewriter
,
which
used
a
single
spherical
typing
element
rather
than
individual
character
hammers
;
it
could
easily
be
converted
by
replacing
the
qwerty
typing
element
with
an
available
dvorak
equivalent
.

there
are

studies

it
is
unclear
if
phytoestrogens
have
any
effect
on
the
cause

prevention
of
cancer
in
females
.
epidemiological
studies
showed
a
protective
effect
against

cancer

'

'
studies
concluded
that

with
current
or
past
breast
cancer
should
be
aware
of
the
risks
of
potential
tumor
growth
when
taking

a

review

stated
the
opinion
that
not
enough
information
is
available
,
and
that
even
if
isoflavones
have
mechanisms
to
inhibit
tumor
growth
,
'
in

results
justify
the
need
to
evaluate
,
at
cellular
level
,
the
impact
of
isoflavones
on
breast
tissue
in
females
at
high
risk
for
breast
cancer
.
the
generally
accepted
position
on
this
topic
is
that
phytoestrogens
may
be
beneficial
for
healthy
females
and
that
females
with
known
breast
cancer
should
be
aware
of
potential
risks
and
consider
avoiding
consumption
until
more
information
is
available

social
predation
allows
some
animals
to
organize
hunts
of
creatures
that
would
easily
escape
a
single
predator
;
thus
chimpanzees
can
prey
upon
colubus
monkeys
,
and
harrier
hawks
can
cut
off
all
possible
escapes
for
a
doomed
rabbit

extreme
specialization
of
roles
is
evident
in
some
hunting
that
requires
co
-
operation
between
predators
of
very
different
species
:
humans
with
the
aid
of
falcons

dogs
,
or
fishing
with
cormorants

social
predation
is
often
very
complex
behavior
,
and
not
all
social
creatures
(
for
example
,
domestic
cats
)
perform
it
.
even
without
complex
intelligence

the

produces

the

there

other
reasons

those
advanced
by

they
point
to
the
role
the
u.s.

have
played
in
conflicts
around
the

in
the

of

.
engaging
in
such
policies
today
,
under
the
icc
statute
,
could
be
grounds
for
prosecution
.
in
addition
,
they
point
to
the
possible
legal
challenges
,
under
the
command
responsibility
principle
,
as
a
result
of
the
"
war
on
terror
"
regarding
the
memos
refuting
the
geneva
convention
,
the
use
of
unlawful
combatant
status
,
extraordinary
rendition
and
legality
of
the
2003
invasion
of
iraq
.
critics
of
the
u.s.
administration
view
these
as
war
crimes
and
therefore
allege
that
high
level
officials
and
the
administration
itself
might
be
liable
for
criminal
prosecution
.
the
international
criminal
court
investigated
all
allegations
for
war
crimes
and
crimes
against
humanity
and
found
that
all
such
claims
were
without
merit
except
those
already
being
prosecuted
by
national
authorities
.
not
one
member
of

has
brought
such
claims
to

review
and
not
one
member

has
taken
them
seriously
enough
to
bring
them
before

there
is
some
evidence
suggesting

immediately

hare
and
others
take
the
stance
that
psychopathy
as
a
syndrome
should
be
considered
distinct
from
the
dsm

iv
's
antisocial
personality
disorder
construct
,
even
though
apd
and
psychopathy
were
intended
to
be
equivalent
in
the
dsm
-
iv.
however
,
those
who
created
the
dsm
-
iv
felt
that
there
was
too
much
room
for
subjectivity
on
the
part
of
clinicians
when
identifying
things
like
remorse
and
guilt
;
therefore
,
the
dsm
-
iv
panel
decided
to
stick
to
observable
behaviour
,
namely
socially
deviant
behaviours
.
as
a
result
,
the
diagnosis
of
apd
is
something
that
the
"
majority
of
criminals
easily
meet
.
"
hare
goes
further
to
say
that
the
percentage
of
incarcerated
criminals
that
meet
the
requirements
of
apd
is
somewhere
between
80
to
85
percent
,
whereas
only
about
20
%
of
these
criminals
would
qualify
for
a
diagnosis
of
psychopath
.
this
twenty
percent
,
according
to
hare
,
accounts
for
50
percent
of
all
the
most
serious
crimes
committed
,
including
half
of
all

and

worries
over
such
a
major
alteration
to
the
formula
of
one
of
their
main
products
(
a
high
profile
example
of
this
being
new
coke
,
with
a
more
direct
example
being
in
the
late
1980s
when
one
of
persil
's
competitors
,
daz
,
introduced
a
new
formula
that
also
increased
cleaning
performance
,
but
caused
allergic
reactions
in
a
small
but
noticeable
percentage
of
the
population
)
.
to
this
end
they
decided
to
split
the
catalyst
agent
(
together
with
some
fabric
softening
agents
)
into
a
new
product
,
persil
power
.
some
believe
that
,
had
power
been
successful
,
unilever
would
have
created
a
unified
version
of
persil
with
the
catalysing
agents
.
power
was
launched
with
a
large
publicity
campaign
,
but
a
number
of
problems
soon
became
apparent
.
this
view
of
a
combination
of
two
aspects
of
human
existence
is
to
be
considered
as
an
idea
influenced
by
the
christians
and
the
hindus
beliefs
wide
spread
amongst
the
muslim
laymen
,
especially
amongst
the
sufi
branch
of
islam
,
which
are
not
presented
so
in
the
islamic
texts
.
briefly
,
the
concept
of
soul
widespread
amongst
the
muslims
today
is
a
mixture
of
greek
-
hindu
-
christian
beliefs
and
islamic
sources
.
islam
itself
discerns
between
"
ruh
"
and
"
nafs
"
just
like
it
is
done
in
the
hebrew
language
.
both
"
ruh
"
and
"
nafs
"
are
translated
into
soul
causing
much
confusion
concerning
the
two
different
concepts
.
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
the
quran
treats
the
soul
(
ruh
)
as
the
place
of
feelings
or
thinking
.
no
where
in
quran
it
is
said
that
the
ruh
of
man
which
is
the
source
of
life
speaks
to
him
or
whispers
to
him
but
it
is
often
said
that
his
nafs
whispered
to
him
.
but
nafs
is
not
the
source
of
life
.
it
is
something
other
than
the
ruh
.
but
partly
because
of
the
hellenistic
influence
and
latter
the
influence
of
the
hindus
in
the
indian
sub
continent
and
under
the
influence
of
the
persians
it
has
become
more
widespread
amongst
the
muslims
that
the
source
of
life
which
is
the
ruh
is
the
centre
of
feelings
and
thinking
with
an
independent
entity
.
in
order
to
understand
the
concept
of
soul
amongst
the
laymen
muslims
you
would
need
to
understand
this
concept
from
a
greek
-
hindu
and
christian
perspective
.
when
you
compare
it
to
the
islamic
texts
you
would
find
out
that
this
more
widespread
concept
of
soul
is
hardly
traceable
to
the
quran
itself
except
if
you
force
yourself
to
make
it
seem
so
.
relatively
little
is
known
about
the
early
settlement
of
much
of
south
america
east
of
the
andes
.
this
is
due
to
the
lack
of
stone
(
generally
required
for
leaving
durable
artifacts
)
,
and
a
jungle
environment
that
rapidly
recycles
organic
materials
.
beyond
the
andean
regions
,
where
the
inhabitants
were
more
clearly
related
to
the
early
cultures
of
peru
,
early
finds
are
generally
limited
to
coastal
areas
and
those
areas
where
there
are
stone
outcrops
.
while
there
is
evidence
of
human
habitation
in
northern
brazil
as
early
as
8000bce
and
rock

of
unknown
(
or
at

to
be

long
,
at
its
lower

between

,
where
it
emerges
from

on

the

has
walls
that
rise
approximately
1000
ft
(
300

from

the

drops
from

elevation

magnol
's
most
important
contribution
to
science
is
without
doubt
the
invention
of
the
concept
of
plant
families
,
a
natural
classification
,
based
on
combinations
of
morphological
characters
,
as
set
out
in

in
quo

disponuntur
'
(

in
magnol
's
day
it
was
common
belief
that
all
species
had
come
into
existence
by
divine
creation
as
set
out
in
the
book
of
genesis
.
nevertheless
his
work
may
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
first
steps
towards
the
composition
of
a
tree
of
life
.
in
his
'
prodromus
'
he
developed
75
tables
,
which
not
only
grouped
plants
into
families
but
also
allowed
for
an
easy
and
rapid
identification
by
means
of
the
morphological
characters

he
used
to
compose

political
entity
,
such
as
an
administrative
division

a
sovereign
state
that
extends
into
another
such
entity
as
a
peninsula
extends
into
the
sea
.
the
former
"
folksy
"
term
derives
from
the
analogous
part
of
a
cooking
pan
and
its
use
is
generally
confined
to
the

a
panhandle
is
similar
to

in
shape

it

not
surrounded

water
on

sides
(

land
region
surrounded
on
three

not
of

the
panhandle
shape
is
the
result
of
arbitrarily
drawn
international
or
subnational
boundaries
,
although
the
location
of
some
administrative

takes
into

other
considerations

the

it
turns
out
that

whilst
"

,

,
never

"
,
according
to
a
christian
historian
committed
pagans
continued
,
wherever
possible
,
to
practice
their

discreetly
or
under
cloak
of
common
festivals

by
keeping
within
the
letter
of

law

upon
the
death
of
theodosius
,
in
395
,
the
empire
was
divided
between
his
two
incompetent
sons
.
political
crisis
ensued
;
over
the
next
several
decades
,
the
defence
of
the
empire
gradually
collapsed
.
during
this
prolonged
disaster
,
some
christians
became
less
certain
of
their
religion
and
converted
back
to
the
old
religion
.
pagans
blamed
the
christians
for
the
disasters
affecting
the
empire
.
eunapius
reflects
some
of
the
pagan
attitudes
of
this
period
in
his
writings
.
despite
the
pleas
of
many
pagans
for
tolerance
,
honorius
and
arcadius
continued
the
work
of
their
father
by
enacting
even
more
anti
-
pagan
laws
to
stop
any
revival
of
paganism
.
the
fact
that
they
had
to
keep
repeating
their
threats
by
the
enactment
of
numerous
laws
against
the
practice
of
paganism
indicates
that
their
efforts
did
not
succeed
in
stamping
out
the
old
religion
,
which
continued
to
be
practiced
discreetly
.
during
the
early
part
of
the
reign
of
honorius
,
stilicho
was
able
to
exercise
unlimited
power
over
the
west
.
in
the
year
395
,
arcadius
declared
that
the
solemn
days
of
the
pagans
were
no
longer
to
be
included
in
the
number
of
holidays
.
in
the
same
year
,
another
law
was
passed
by
arcadius
that
prohibited
anyone
from
going
to
a
pagan
sanctuary
or
temple
or
of
celebrating
any
kind
of
pagan
sacrifice
.
this
law
seems
to
have
been
targeted
at
those
christians
who
were
converting
back
to
paganism
as
it
specifically
mentions
"
those
who
are
trying
to
stray
from
the
dogma
of
the
catholic
faith
.
"
in
the
year
396
,
the
privileges
of
pagan
priests
and
other
clerics
were
officially
revoked
.
in
the
same
year
,
arcadius
ordered
that
pagan
temples
standing
in
the
country
were
to
be
destroyed
without
disorder
or
riot
such
that
they
could
not
be
used
for
religious
rites
away
from
gaze
of
the
authorities
.
the
large
number
of
pagans
in
the
east
also
seems
to
have
forced
arcadius
into
allowing
the
ancient
festivals
and
public
games
to
continue
but
without
religious
rites
that
formed
an
essential
part
of
the
old
religion
.

behavioral

including
cognitive
behavioral

and
graded
exercise
therapy
(
get
)
have
been
shown
to
be
at
least
partially
effective
in
some
people

the
statement
of
principal
findings
regarding
cbt/get
was
:
"
a
number
of
rcts
(
randomised
controlled
trials
)
suggest
that
behavioural
interventions
,
including
elements
of
cbt
,
get
and
rehabilitation
,
may
reduce
symptoms
and
improve
physical
functioning
of
people
with

"
however
some
uncertainty
still
exists
over
the
efficacy
of
these
treatments
,
especially
get
for
severely
affected
patients
,
as
none
were
included
in
studies
that
passed
the
inclusion
criteria
of
the
review
.
the
review
also
emphasized
the
need
for
more
and
better
conducted
studies
of
both
therapies
,
as
well
as
more
research
into
the
adverse
affects
of
treatments
in
general
as
they
may
be
under
reported
or
poorly
quantified
.
as
mentioned
in
the
review
under
the
'
unanswered
questions/further
research
'
section
,
very
few
studies
assessed
the
effectiveness
of
"
interventions
for
children
and
young
people
and
for
severely
affected
patients
.
"
more
research
is
needed
on
severely
affected
patients
in
general
;
because
many
treatments
and
studies
require
patients
to
attend
a
clinic
,
and
those
with
the
worst
symptoms
often
receive
the
least
support
from
health
and
social
services
.
the
authors
also
expressed
concern
about
possible
bias
in
the
cfs
literature
,
a
lack
of
uniformity
in
case
definitions
and
study
inclusion/exclusion
criteria
(
studies
using
any
cfs
criteria
were
included
)
,
and
the
basic
information
provided
about
the
participants
;
which
they
state
makes
it
difficult
to
assess
the
generalizability
of
the
findings
of
many
of
these
studies
.
this
review
found
that
no
intervention
had
been
proved
effective
in
restoring
the
ability
to
work
.
an
earlier
systematic
review
published
in
2002
also
found
this
,
although
cbt
was
"
lending
a
possible
association
between
improvement
in
the
ability
to
work
and
an
increase
in
the
number
of
patients
employed
"
.
this
earlier
review
also
found
that
no
specific
patient
characteristics
seemed
to
serve
as
best
predictors
of
positive
employment
outcomes
in
cfs
patients
,
although
did
find
that
depression
of
greater
severity
was
associated
with
unemployment
.
however
,
another
systematic
review
published
in
2004
concluded
"
only
cognitive
behavior
therapy
,
rehabilitation
,
and
exercise
therapy
interventions
were
associated
with

they
state
that
both
cbt
and
get
are
not
only
just
unhelpful
to
many
severely
affected
cfs
patients
but
also
dangerous/harmful
.
the
discrepancy
between
trial
results
and
patient
group
surveys
has
been
noted
by
the
p.a.c.e.
trial
group
,
who
are
conducting
a
larger
more
detailed
study
into
cbt
and
get
which
is
currently
underway
and
is
due
for
completion
in
2009
.
in
the
1940s
,
the
integration
of
traditional
authorities
into
the
colonial
administration
was
deepened
,
a
level
of
social
integration
,
miscegenation
and
social
promotion
based
in
skill
and
human
qualities
of
each
individual
,
rather
than
in
the
ethnic
background
,
which
was
coined
'
lusotropicalismo
'
and
had
been
a
major
feature
of
the
portuguese
empire
throughout
history
.
gradually
,
these
"
traditional
"
titles
lost
some
of
their
content
,
and
the
'
régulos
'
and
'
cabos
de
terra
'
came
to
be
viewed
as
an
effective
part
of
the
colonial
state
,
remunerated
for
their
participation
in
the
collection
of
taxes
,
recruitment
of
the
labor
force
,
and
agricultural
production
in
the
area
under
their
control
.
in
major
urban
areas
,
most
notoriously
the
cosmopolitan
provincial
ports
of
lourenço
marques
and
beira
,
racial
integration
and
socioeconomic
opportunities
for
all
kind
of
skilled
citizens
were
already
very
deep
.
from
then
on
,
all
africans
were
considered
portuguese
citizens
,
and
racial
discrimination
became
a
sociological
rather
than
a
legal
feature
of
colonial
society
.
altering
hormone
signals
can
change
how
the
body
works
and
may
lead
to
health
problems

some
people
speculate
that
endocrine
disrupting
compounds
may
be
linked
to
many
health
concerns
,
such
as
cancer
,
diabetes
,
obesity
,
learning
disabilities
and
behavioural
problems
.
solid
human
evidence
linking
edcs
with
these
kinds
of
effects

determine

their
is
increasing
evidence
from
the
fields
of
epidemiology
,
toxicology
,
environmental
health
,
and

suggests
there

'
panzer
ii
'
is
the
common
name
of
a
german
tank
used
in
world
war
ii.
designed
as
a
stopgap
while
other
tanks
were
developed
,
it
played
an
important
role
in
the
early
years
of
world
war
ii
,
during
the
polish
and
french
campaigns
.
by
the
end
of
1942
it
was
largely
removed
from
frontline
service
and
production
of
the
tank
itself
ceased
by
1943
,
but
its
chassis
was
used
for
several
other
armored
vehicles
.
in
1934
,
delays
in
the
design
and
production
of
the
panzer
iii
and
panzer
iv
tanks
were
becoming
apparent
.
production
began
in
1935
,
but
it
took
another
eighteen
months
for
the
first
combat
-
ready
tank
to
be

.
probably
this
was
a
bust
of
napoleon
's
son
,
who
was
known
as
the
king
of
rome
.
the
presumption
is
that
this
was
overpainted
with
the
curtain
after
the
fall
of
napoleon
,
either
by
ingres
himself
,
or
another
artist
.
the
bust
can
just
be
made
out
in
the
enlarged
online
photo
,
with
its
chin
level
with
the
sitter
's
hair
-
line
;
the
top
of
the
column
was
level
with
the
middle
of
the
sitter
's
ear
.
these
may
always
have
been
(
just
)
visible
,
or
have
become
so
by
the
paint
becoming
transparent
with
age
.
strictly
speaking
,
these
alterations
might
not
be
described
as
pentimenti
,
because
of
the
presumed
lapse
of
time
,
and
because
another
artist
may
have
made
the
change
.
he
eagerly
labored
for
an
agreement
,
for
his
patristic
studies
and
the
dialogue
(
1530
)
of
ocolampadius
had
made
him
doubt
the
correctness
of
luther
's
doctrine
.
bucer
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
believe
with
luther
that
the
true
body
of
christ
in
the
lord
's
supper
is
bitten
by
the
teeth
,
but
admitted
the
offering
of
the
body
and
blood
in
the
symbols
of
bread
and
wine
.
melanchthon
discussed
bucer
's
views
with
the
most
prominent
adherents
of
luther
;
but
luther
himself
would
not
agree
to
a
mere
veiling
of
the
dispute
.
melanchthon
's
relation
to
luther
was
not
disturbed
by
his
work
as
a
mediator
,
although
luther
for
a
time
suspected
that
melanchthon
was
"
almost
of
the
opinion
of
zwingli
"
;
nevertheless
he
desired
to
"
share
his
heart
with
him
.
"
although
some
lipid
-
binding
proteins
are
able
to
insert
themselves
into
membranes
and
could
hypothetically
recognise
the
type
of
acyl
chain
or
the
resulting
properties
of
the
membrane
,
many
lipid
-
binding
proteins
are
cytosolic
and
localise
to
the
membrane
by
binding
only
the
headgroups
of
lipids
.
if
this
is
the
case
,
it
suggests
that
a
pa
-
binding
domain
must
not
only
be
able
to
bind
pa
specifically
but
must
also
be
able
to
identify
those
head
-
groups
that
are
at
the
correct
angle
.
whatever
the
mechanism
is
,
such
specificity
is
possible
.
thus
it
seems
that
,
though
pa
and
dag
are
interconvertible
,
the
different
species
of
lipid
can
have
different
biological
activities
;
and
this
may
enable
the
two
lipids
to
maintain
separate
signaling
pathways
.
if
looking
for
the
maximum
possible
displacement
,
a
twin
rotor
wankel
rotary
displacing
654cc
per
combustion
chamber
(
such
as
the
mazda
13b
)
has
a
maximum
displacement
of
3924cc
(
3.9
liters
)
.
this
is
because
there
are
three
possible
combustion
chambers
per
rotor
,
each
displacing
654cc
at
full
expansion
.
654cc
per
face
,
three
faces
per
rotor
(
1962cc/2
liters
)
,
two
rotors
per
engine
(
3924cc/3.9
liters
)
.
taking
combustion
chamber
volume
and
multiplying
by
the
total
number
of
possible
combustion
chambers
per
engine
.
this
means
comparing
a
hypothetical
3.9
liter
piston
engine
to
a
'
1.3
liter
'
wankel
rotary
(
with
a
maximum
possible
displacement
of
3.9
liters
)
using
this
method
will
result
in
the
the
piston
engine
's
theoretical
specific
output
being
approximately
50
%
higher
than
the
wankel
rotary
because
the
piston
engine
will
displace
its
3.9
liters
through
a
power
stroke
one
revolution
(
50
%
)
sooner
than
the
wankel
rotary
.

there
is
a
third
group
that
advocates
an
approach
which
is
sometimes
referred

as
gradualism
.
gradualism
advocates
are
of
the
opinion
that

programs
are
sometimes
rooted
in
pessimism
about
the
ability
of
addicts
to
stop
their
addictive
behaviors

represent
the
"
soft
bigotry

low
expectations
.
"
they
are
unlikely
to
categorize
interventions
as
"
good
"

"
bad
"
.
rather
,
they
tend
to
be
more
concerned
that
programs
should
urge
clients
toward
abstinence
when
windows
of
opportunity
open
.
some
believe
that
zionists
(
or
,
alternatively
,
israel
and
pro
-
israel
lobbying
in
the
us
)
are
the
primary
force
behind
the
conspiracy
.
they
assert
the
establishment
of
the
new
world
order
is
being
engineered
by
neo
-
conservatives
to
provide
support
for
israel
and
they
point
out
that
many
neo
-
conservative
leaders
are
hawkish
zionists
and
some
of
them
have
worked
as
advisors
to
the
government
of
israel
.
claims
have
been
made
that
the
primary
reason
that
the
iraq
war
was
fought
is
that
the
zionists
thought
that
saddam
hussein
was
a
threat
to
israel
that
needed
to
be
removed
.
some
claim
that
it
is
difficult
for
people
to
find
out
the
truth
about
the
conspiracy
because
,
mass
media
outlets
are
predominantly
owned
by
a
few
corporate
executives
who
have
the
same
goal
.
allegedly
these
individuals
in
control

media
are
all
zionists

supporters
of
them

initial
reports
of

,

echoed

claims

based

account
given

had

,

accepted

were
conspiring

this
contrasts
with
the
method
of
the
revolutionary
who
brings
about
a
change
of
conditions
by
displacing
one
government
with
another
:
stirner
was
writing
about
people
liberating
themselves
from
their
own
limits
and
rising
above
limiting
social
,
political
and
ideological
conditions
,
and
for
each
to
walk
their
own
way
.
the
passages
quoted
above
are
clearly
incompatible
with
david
leopold
's
conclusion
(
in
his
introduction
to
the
cambridge
university
press
edition
)
that
stirner
"
...
saw
humankind
as
'
fretted
in
dark
superstition
'
but
denied
that
he
sought
their
enlightenment
and
welfare
"
.
stirner
refused
to
describe
himself
as
directly
liberating
others
.
but
his
stated
purpose
in
these
quotations
seems
to
be
to
achieve
the

enlightenment

"
of
others
by
way
of
demonstration

short

pushed

the
term
"
type
"
has
not
been
used
consistently
in

and
has
become
the
source
of
some
confusion
.
furthermore
,
because
personality
test
scores
usually
fall
on
a
bell
curve
rather
than
in
distinct
categories
,
personality
type
theories
have
received
considerable
criticism
among
psychometric
researchers
.
most
researchers
now
believe
that
it
is
impossible
to
explain
the
diversity
of
human
personality
with
a
small
number
of
discrete
types
.
during
battles
,
western
forces
were
usually
incapable
of
correctly
estimating
the
strength
of
pva
forces
,
often
,
they
greatly
exaggerated
the
number
of
attacking
pvas
,
such
as
taking
a
pva
regiment
as
a
pva
division
.
moreover
,
pvas
were
masters
of
infiltration
,
they
often
sneaked
in
and
attacked
directly
on
command
posts
,
generating
shock
and
chaos
.
as
some
military
analysts
pointed
out
,
pla
rarely
use
dense
formation
in

attacks
,
it
seeks
to
inflict
maximum
damage
with
minimum
casualty
.
at
various
stages
of
the
korean
war
,
pva
never
had
a
commanding
numerical
superiority
against
un
forces
,
in
fact
,
during
the
4th
campaign
,
it
was
greatly
outnumbered
by
un
(
it
was
always
outgunned
)
,

it

with
modern
scientific
theories
on

it
holds
that
the

not

days
,
but
rather
are
much
longer
periods
(

.
the

is
then
interpreted

lo

drew
comparisons
to

predecessors
mike

mike
piazza
--
all
three
were
capable

catchers

were

all
three

lo

primary
strength
is
as
a
contact
hitter
,
like
scioscia
,

unlike
the
power

hitting
piazza
.
lo
duca
would
forge
another
connection

to

after

years
the

not
very
successful
at
raising
the
required

in
1877
many
of
the
directors
were
succeeded
by
a
new
group
of
pittsburgh
businessmen

group
was

child
sexual
abuse
occurs
frequently
in
western
society
.
prevalence
figures
range
between
10
%
to
62
%
for
females
and
16
%
for
males
.
denial
by
others
of
child
sexual
abuse
is
common
and
its
reality
is
not
easily
accepted
.
questioning
the
validity
of
allegations
made
by
children
is
the
most
common
form
of
denial
.
child
sexual
abuse
has
a
difficult
burden
of
proof
in
criminal
courts
.
it
is
possible
that
false
allegations
may
be
over
-
represented
,
because
many
true
victims
of
child
sexual
abuse
never
tell
anyone
at
all
about
what
happened
.
the
frequency
of
false
allegations
was
found
to
be
six
percent
by
emergency
room
staff
.
false
retractions
are
also
common
.
other
studies
have
shown
false
allegation
rates
to
be
as
low
as
two
percent
.
some
studies
break
down
the
level
of
false
allegations
by
the
age
of
the
child
.
in
a
1989
everson
and
boat
study
,
among
pre
-
school
children
,
the
rate
was
found
to
be
between
1.7
to
2.7
percent
.
among
adolescents
,
the
rate
was
found
to
be
between
8
to
12
percent
.
the
overall
average
rate
was
found
to
be
5
to
8
percent
.
higher
rates
of
false
allegations
are
found
in
custody
disputes
.
children
appear
to
rarely
make
up
false
allegations
of
their
own
accord
.
the
denial
of
offenses
is
strong
among
men
that
commit
sexual
offenses
.
many
continue
to
deny
their
offenses
even
after
conviction
.
it
is
suggested
that
parents
have
consistently
underestimated
the
seriousness
of
their
child
's
distress
when
compared
to
accounts
of
their
own
children
.
adults
that
were
abused
as
children
may
be
reluctant
to
disclose
their
abuse
if
they
are
attached
to
their
offender
.
any
group
of
10
members
may
raise
the
question
of
the
legality
of
the
minister
's
official
acts
.
the
criminal
investigation
of
the
constitutional
committee
may
also
be
initiated
by
the
chancellor
of
justice
,
parliamentary
ombudsman
or
by
any
parliamentary
committee
.
similar
proceedings
may
also
be
initiated
against
the
chancellor
of
justice
,
parliamentary
ombudsman
or
the
judges
of
the
supreme
courts
.
the
president
of
finland
may
be
also
the
target
of
a
criminal
investigation
of
the
constitutional
committee
,
but
the
parliament
must
accept
the
indictment
by
a
majority
of
three
-
fourths
and
the
charge
must
be
treason
,
high
treason
or
a
crime
against
humanity
.

if
the
pawnshop
owner
believes
that
there
are
"
too
many
used
tvs
around
these

"
,
they
may
fear
that

will
only
get
$
100
for

if
they
have
to
unload
it
to
a

,
the
customer
who
comes
in
with
this
tv
that
they
paid
$
1000
for
when
it
was

may
be
offered
as
little
as
$
50
by

taking

all
of
the
risk

cost
factors

in
determining
the
amount
of

,
the

also
assesses
the
likelihood
that

customer
will
pay
the
interest
for
several
weeks
or
months
and
then
return
to
repay
the
loan

reclaim

item
.
since
the
key
to
the
pawnshop
business
model
is
making
interest
off
of
the
loaned
money
,
pawnshop
owners
want
to
accept

according
to

if
the
president
,
who

decided
to
order
the
use
of

he
would
be
taken
aside

the

open

at
that
point
,
the

as

before

inspiration

have
changed
themselves
to

.
the
process
of
free
trade
,
especially
in
post
industrial
economies
,
effectively
eliminates
the
existence
of
unequal
resource
distribution
.
japan
imports
much
of
its
food
source
,
and
in
return
exports
mainly
the
produce
of
its
extensive
and
high
-
tech
workforce
.
continuing
the
example
,
japan
would
not
likely
be
able
to
sustain
the
population
it
does
today
without
one
of
three
possibilities
:
an
unbelievable
increase
in
technology
to
allow
for
better
use
of
land
resources
,
international
trade
,
or
seizing
arable
land
from
another
state
.
trade
also
allows
for
better
quality
produce
and
competitiveness
between
nations
,
effectively
raising
the
living
standards
of
those
nations
.
it
would
be
illogical
to
many
in
such
a
case
to
jeopardise
those
living
standards
for
a
war
.
finally
,
increased
trade
leads
to
increased
bilateral
communication
between
nations
and
as
such
,
wars
not
focused
on
resources
or
land
already
cured
by
trade
,
including
ideological
arguments
become
less
evident
.
in

,
the
boy
scouts
association
,
hong

branch
purchased
land
for
the
chai
wan

where
chai

the

returned
to

a
'
paper
popper
'
is
a
party
prank
that
is
commonly
practiced
in
public
schools
.
there
a
many
variations
of
a
paper
popper
,
but
they
all
involve
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
being
gripped
and
thrusted
down
,
causing
air
to
be
forced
into
the
paper
's
folded
flaps
,
making
the
paper
flaps
pop
out
in
the
opposite
direction
at
a
high
velocity
,
thus
making
a
loud
popping
noise
.
according
to
popular
misconception
the
sound
is
supposed
to
be
caused
by
the
paper
breaking
the
sound
barrier
.
most
papers
work
for
poppers
,
although
some
are
louder
than
others
.
a
similar
accusation
was
made
at
the
same
time
against
another
bishop
,
juan
arias
davila
,
of
segovia
.
as
a
result
,
both
bishops
were
summoned
to
rome
,
where
subsequently
several
distinctions
were
accorded
to
davila
,
who
during
the
remainder
of
his
life
enjoyed
high
honors
.
he
was
arraigned
for
having
taken
food
before
mass
and
for
having
desecrated
,
by
scratching
,
a
crucifix
and
other
holy
images
.
observing
the
pope
's
resolve
to
imprison
aranda
,
garcilaso
pointed
out
the
suspicion
that
was
likely
to
arise
in
the
popular
mind
from
the
anomalous
incarceration
of
aranda
while
the
marrano
delegates
,
indubitable
heretics
,
were
granted
favor
and
freedom
.
as
a
fast
-
expanding
suburb
during
the
19th
century
portobello
attracted
many
upwardly
-
mobile
families
whose
members
went
on
to
play
important
roles
in
politics
,
the
arts
and
the
sciences
.
although
usually
referred
to
as
portobello
bridge
,
the
correct
name
is
la
touche
bridge
(
named
after
william
digges
la
touche
(
1747
-
1803
)
,
scion
of
a
prominent
dublin
business
family
and
a
director
of
the
grand
canal
company
)
.
for
some
unaccountable
reason
he
took
his
army
over
to
finglas
,
where
he
spent
a
month
,
which
allowed
the
roundheads
to
reinforce
and
plan
their
attack
.
ormonde
's
army
was
defeated
,
many
of
them
killed
,
and
the
place
where
they
fell
(
mainly
between
rathmines
and
ranelagh
)
was
known
for
a
long
time
as
the
bloody
fields
.
in
1848
,
in
spite
of
his
reluctance
,
he
was
elected
to
the
constituent
assembly
,
by
so
large
a
number
of
votes
(
204,471
)
that
he
felt
himself
obliged
to
accept
the
seat
.
nothing
could
exceed
the
amiability
of
his
private
character
;
so
poor
a
man
has
rarely
been
so
rich
in
good
actions
;
he
was
always
ready
to
receive
help
from
his
friends
when
he
was
in
need
,
and
always
forward
to
help
others
.
he
occupied
some
of
his
leisure
in
preparing
his
own
memoirs
,
and
a
certain
treatise
on
'
social
and
political
morality
'
,
intended
for
the
people
,
a
work
he
had
much
at
heart
,
but
judged
at
last
to
be
beyond
his
strength
.
on
his
death
,
it
was
feared
that
his
funeral
would
be
the
signal
for
some
political
disturbance
;
but
the
government
took
immediate
measures
,
and
all
went
quietly
.
it
has
been
suggested
that
this
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
philodendrons
have
many
geographic
and
time
barriers
that
would
prevent
any
such
cross
pollination
.
its
also
the
case
that
since
philodendron
often
are
pollinated
by
specific
species
of
beetles
that
this
would
prevent
cross
pollination
.
the
beetles
have
also
been
observed
to
be
selective
to
the
height
of
the
plant
they
pollinate
which
would
serve
as
an
additional
preventitive
measure
that
would
make
hybrids
less
likely
.
an
interesting
feature
of
these
hybrids
is
that
they
often
can
show
remarkable
types
of
crosses
with
regards
to
genetic
relation
.
blackberries
and
raspberries
(
'
rubus
'
spp
.
)
can
resemble
poison
ivy
,
with
which
they
may
share
territory
.
the
chief
difference
between
blackberries
and
raspberries
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
poison
ivy
,
on
the
other
,
is
that
blackberries
and
raspberries
almost
always
have
prickles
on
the
stems
,
whereas
poison
ivy
is
smooth
.
also
,
the
three
-
leaflet
pattern
of
some
blackberry
and
raspberry
leaves
changes
as
the
plant
grows
:
leaves
produced
later
in
the
season
have
five
leaflets
rather
than
three
.
blackberries
and
raspberries
have
many
fine
teeth
along
the
leaf
edge
,
the
top
surface
of
their
leaves
is
very
wrinkled
where
the
veins
are
,
and
the
bottom
of
the
leaves
is
light
minty
-
greenish
white
.
mary
is
also
shown
as
being
totally
faithful
towards
christ
,
especially
during
his
passion
,
when
he
was
abandoned
by
his
followers
,
even
the
apostles
(
apart
from
the
young
john
)
.
mary
's
complete
faithfulness
could
be
the
fruit
of
being
sinless
,
as
she
could
not
then
reject
christ
in
the
darkest
hour
.
in
support
to
this
doctrine
,
it
also
does
not
appear
fit
that
christ
,
god
-
incarnate
,
should
be
born
in
sinful
vessel
.
the
immaculate
conception
also
compares
to
the
original
righteousness
of
adam
and
eve
.
a
few
months
later
in
december
of
415
,
another
synod
in
diospolis
(
lydda
)
under
a
cesarean
bishop
was
called
by
two
deposed
bishops
who
came
to
palestine
.
pelagius
explained
to
the
synod
that
he
did
believe
god
was
necessary
for
salvation
because
every
human
is
created
by
god
.
he
also
claimed
that
many
works
of
celestius
did
not
represent
his
own
views
.
he
also
showed
letters
of
recommendation
by
other
authoritative
figures
including
augustine
himself
who
,
for
all
their
disagreements
,
thought
highly
of
pelagius
'
character

strategy
is
considered
to
be
very
important
during
penalty
shots
and
overtime
shootouts
for
both
the
shooter
and
the
goalie
.
both
shooters
and
goalies
commonly
consult
their
teammates
and
coaches
for
advice
on
the
opposing
player
's
style
of
play
.
shooters
often
consider
the
goalie
's
strengths
and
weaknesses
(
such
as
a
fast
glove
or
stick
save
)
,
preferred
goaltending
style
(
such
as
butterfly

and

of

goaltenders
often
consider

as
judge
during
the
anna
nicole
smith
body
custody
hearing
.
judge
seidlin
was
involved
in
some
controversial
actions
,
such
as
making
one
-
liners
and
other
attempts
at
humor
which
some
who
know
him
said
is
normal
for
him
,
but
led
many
to
speculate
that
his
actions
and
comments
were
for
the
cameras
in
the
courtroom
and
were
made
as
an
attempt
to
secure
a
courtroom
television
show
similar
to
judge
judy
's
.
the
judgment
was
given
in
what
some
have
viewed
as
an
overly
theatrical
style
,
with
the
judge
weeping
and
fumbling
his
words
,
though
others
close
to
him
have
said
that
his
courtroom
conduct
was
genuine

it
is
very
important
for
regeneration
of
pinyon

,
as
it
stores
large
numbers
of
the
seeds
in
the
ground
for
later
use
,
and
excess
seeds
not
used
are
in
an
ideal
position
to
grow
into
new

.
the
mexican
jay
is
also
important
for
the
dispersal
of
some
pinyon
species
as
,
less
often
,
is
the
clark
's
nutcracker
.
many
other
species
of

also
eat
pinyon
nuts
,
without
dispersing
them

distinctions
based
on
geologic
age
also
correspond
to
physiographic
distinctions
where
the
forms
are
so
recent
as
to
be
in
their
first
erosion
cycle
,
as
is
generally
the
case
with
sheets
of
glacial
drift
.
generally
,
forms
which
result
from
similar
histories
are
characterized
by
certain
similar
features
,
and
differences
in
history
result
in
corresponding
differences
of
form
,
usually
resulting
in
distinctive
features
which
are
obvious
to
the
casual
observer
,
but
this
is
not
always
the
case
.
a
maturely
dissected
plateau
may
grade
without
a
break
from
rugged
mountains
on
the
one
hand
to
mildly
rolling
farm
lands
on
the
other
.
so
also
,
forms
which
are
not
classified
together
may
be
superficially
similar
;
for
example
,
a
young
coastal
plain
and
a
peneplain
.
one
of
the
most
important
echoes
of
plautus
is
the
stock
character
of
the
parasite
.
certainly
the
best
example
of
this
is
falstaff
,
shakespeare
's
portly
and
cowardly
knight
.
as
j.
w.
draper
notes
,
the
gluttonous
falstaff
shares
many
characteristics
with
a
parasite
such
as
artotrogus
from
'
miles
gloriosus
.
'
of
course
,
draper
notes
that
falstaff
is
also
something
of
a
boastful
military
man
,
but
notes
,
“
falstaff
is
so
complex
a
character
that
he
may
well
be
,
in
effect
,
a
combination
of
interlocking
types
.
”
later
in
the
century
the
patronage
came
to
be
shared
between
basset
and
the
duke
of
leeds
,
though
in
the
last
years
before
reform
basset
's
son
(
who
became
lord
de
dunstanville
)
was
allowed
to
exercise
patronage
alone
on
the
understanding
that
he
did
not
interfere
in
the
duke

helston

elections
were
generally
contested
,
and
the
outcome
was
often
a
sharing
of
the
representation
with
one
whig
and
one
tory
returned
.
in
this
final
period
,
elections
in
penryn
became
notoriously
corrupt
,
although
as
namier
suggests
the
notoriety
may
have
arisen
chiefly
from
the
fact
the
bribery
now
involved
private
citizens
on
both
sides
instead
of
the
government
being
complicit
in
it
.
in
1828
,
two
years
before
the
first
attempt
to
pass
a
general
reform
act
,
the
whigs
picked
penryn
as
a
suitable
case
for
an
attempt
at
more
limited
reform
after
an
election
where
voters
were
reportedly
treated
to
a
"
breakfast
"
worth
24
guineas
a
head
;
they
proposed
a
bill
in
the
house
of
commons
to
disfranchise
penryn
and
transfer
its
two
seats
to
manchester
,
but
as
there
was
at
this
point
a
tory
majority
opposed
to
reform
the
proposal
was
defeated
.
another
famous
tune
featured
in
'
malcolm
'
,
along
with
other
films
,
is
"
music
for

"
,
which
jeffes
wrote
on

where
he
was
staying
in
the
summer
of
1982
after
the
ensemble
's

he
wrote
that

this

loss
can
lead
to

this
can

in

a

culture
does
not
generally
experience
this
isolation
,
particularly
if
he/she

may

experience
isolation
from

a

(
using

can
experience
social
isolation

if
no
one
takes
the
time
to
explicitly
teach

,
since

feel
that

panetti

one
reason
this

was
overlooked
(
or
downplayed
)
is
that
,
once
introduced
,
diseases
raced
ahead
of
european
immigration
in
many
areas
.
after
the
epidemics
had
already
killed
massive
numbers
of
natives
,
many
newer
european
immigrants
assumed
that
there
had
always
been
relatively
few
indigenous
peoples
.
the
scope
of
the
epidemics
over
the
years
was
vast
,
killing
millions
of
people
—
possibly
in
excess
of
90
%
of
the
population
in
the
hardest
hit
areas—and
creating
one
of
"
the
greatest
human
catastrophe
in
history
,
far
exceeding
even
the
disaster
of
the
black
death
of
medieval
europe
that
killed
up
to
one

third
of

although
this

was
entirely
different
mineralogically
from
that
of
his
father
,
william
did
not
take
out
a
patent
,
or
give
it
a
new

.
apparently
,
he
was
aware
of
the
competence
of
a
number
of
competing
manufacturers
near
to
his
plant
on
the
thames
,
and
decided
that
any
patent
would
quickly
be
infringed
by
all
his
rivals
.
he
therefore
decided
to
claim
that
the
product
was
covered
by
his
father
's
patent
,
and
clothed
the
details
of
his
methods
in
secrecy
.
famously
,
he
would
emerge
from
his
office
when
each
newly

loaded
kiln
was
ready
for
firing
,
and
scatter
in
handfuls
of
brightly

coloured
crystals
over
the

,
in
order
to
give
the
impression
that
the
special
properties
of
his
product
were
the
result
of
an
unidentified
"

kept

once
joked
he
will
leave

if

were
to
be
elected

in
2008
.
he
currently
lives
in

.
morris
attended
stuyvesant
high
school
in
new

city
,
where
he
was
active
on
the
debate
team
.
he
managed
jerrold

's
campaign
for

;
nadler
has
since
gone
on
to
represent

in

morris
was
also
involved
in
the
first
campaign
of
richard
gottfried
for

state
assembly
in
1970
.

graduated

attended
columbia
where
he
earned
a
bachelor
of
arts
academic
degree
,
graduating
a
year
early
,
in

.
morris
first
worked
with
bill
and
hillary
clinton
during
bill
clinton
's
successful
1978
bid
for
governor
of
arkansas
.
morris
is
credited
by
many
with
engineering
clinton
's
re
-
election
to
the
arkansas
governorship
after
a
humiliating
defeat
at
the
end
of
clinton
's
first
term
.
thus
it
is
not
surprising
president
clinton
turned
to
morris
after
the
mid
-
term
elections
of
1994
,
when
republicans
seized
control
of
the
u.s.
house
and
senate
and
clinton
's
own
chances
for
a
second
presidential
term
seemed
negligible
.
from
the
early
months
of
1995
until
august
of
1996
,
morris
was
a
principal
architect
of
the
clinton
-
gore
re
-
election
strategy
.
morris
did
not
have
a
role
in
clinton
's
successful
1992
presidential
campaign
,
which
instead
was
headed
by
david
wilhelm
,
james
carville
,
george

,
and
paul
begala
.
after
the
1994
mid

term
election
where
republicans
took
control
of
both
houses
of
the
united

congress
and
gained
considerable
power
in
the
states
,
clinton
once
again
sought
morris
'
help
to
prepare
for
the
u.s.
presidential
election
,
1996
presidential
election
.
it
was
morris
who
proposed
a
strategy
that
is
now
referred
to
as
"
triangulation
,
"
where
bill
clinton
would
appeal
to
a
diverse
group
of
voters
by
distancing
himself
from
both
the
democratic
and
republican
parties
.
many
perceived
this
as
a
move
to
the
center
of
the
political
spectrum
,
and
it
disappointed
some
who
had
hoped
clinton
would
pursue
a
more
liberal
policy

enforce
the

levied

to

rate
(
as
in

nor
according

it
allowed

pay

poor
had
to

israelis
are
open
to
compromise
on
the
issue
,
by
means
such
as
the
monetary
reparations
and
family
reunification
initiatives
offered
by
ehud
barak
at
the
camp

summit
.
however
,
the
majority
of
israelis
find
a
comprehensive
right
of
return
for
palestinian
refugees
to
be
unacceptable
.
the
honestreporting
organization
listed
the
following
grounds
for
this
opposition
:
palestinian
flight
from
israel
was
not
compelled
,
but
voluntary
.
after
seven
arab
nations
declared
war
on
israel
in
1948
,
many
arab
leaders
encouraged
palestinians
to
flee
,
in
order
to
make
it
easier
to
rout
the
jewish
state
.
this
point
,
however
,
is
a
matter
of
some
contention
.
certain
actions
on
the
part
of
jewish
militias
were
considered
to
provoke
palestinians
to
leave
israel
.
eye
witness
accounts
from
ain
al
-
zeitoum
and
er
-
rama
,
for
example
,
record
that
the
palmach
assembled
all
of
their
residents
following
the
villages
'
surrender
.
the
jewish
militia
then
demanded
that
all
muslim
residents
depart
for
lebanon
,
and
leave
their
possessions
behind
,
under
pain
of
death
.
still
,
such
cases
were
relatively
rare
,
and
the
vast
majority
of
palestinians
fled
of
their
own
accord
.
since
most
palestinians
chose
their
status
as
refugees
themselves
,
some
argue
that
israel
is
therefore
absolved
of
responsibility
.
in
fact
,
a
1952
memorandum
submitted
to
the
league
of
arab
states
by
the
higher
arab
committee
reveals
that
arab
states
officially
agreed
to
take
responsibility
for
these
refugees
at
the
height
of
the
palestinian
exodus
,
until
such
time
as
israel
would
be
destroyed
:
:
arab
leaders
and
their
ministries
in
arab
capitals
...
declared
that
they
welcomed
the
immigration
of
palestinian
arabs
into
the
arab
countries
until
they
saved
palestine
.
there
is
no
legal
basis
to
demand
repatriation
of
palestinian
refugees
and
their
descendents
.
no
international
legislation
,
un
resolutions
or
agreements
between
israel
and
the
palestinians
require
this
.
since
none
of
the
900,000
jewish
refugees
who
fled
anti
-
semitic
violence
in
the
arab
world
were
ever
compensated
or
repatriated
by
their
former
countries
of
residence—to
no
objection
on
the
part
of
arab
leaders—a
precedent
has
been
set
whereby
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
nation
which
accepts
the
refugees
to
assimilate
them
.
most
israelis
hold{
that
the
inflow
of
millions
of
poor
refugees
(
almost
none
of
whom
were
properly
integrated
by
the
surrounding
arab
countries
)
will
simply
exceed
the
region
's
dwindling
resources
.
although
israel
accepts
the
right
of
the
palestinian
diaspora
to
return
into
a
new
palestinian
state
,
their
return
into
israel
would
be
a
great
danger
for
the
stability
of
the
jewish
state
;
an
influx
of
palestinian
refugees
would
lead
to
the
destruction
of
the
state
of
israel
.
because
a
right
of
return
would
make
arabs
the
majority
within
israel
,
this
would
essentially
seal
the
fate
of
the
jewish
state
.
as
fatah
explains
:
“
to
us
,
the
refugees
issue
is
the
winning
card
which
means
the
end
of
the
israeli
state

similar
persecutions
.
under
pressure
,
some
jews
converted
to
islam
.
the
most
famous
such
convert
was
rashid
al
-
din
,
a
physician
,
historian
and
statesman
,
who
adopted
islam
in
order
to
advance
his
career
at
Öljeitü
's
court
.
however
,
in
1318
he
was
executed
on
fake
charges
of
poisoning
Öljeitü
and
for
several
days
crowds
had
been
carrying
his
head
around
his
native
city
of
tabriz
,
chanting
"
this
is
the

abused

'
prakrit
'
(
also
transliterated
as
'
pracrit
'
)
(
sanskrit
:
)
is
the
name
for
a
group
of
middle
indic
,
indo
-
aryan
languages
,
derived
from
classical
sanskrit
and
other
old
indic
dialects
.
the
word
itself
has
a
flexible
definition
,
being
defined
sometimes
as
,
"
original
,
natural
,
artless
,
normal
,
ordinary
,
usual
"
,
or
"
vernacular
"
,
in
contrast
to
the
literary
and
religious
orthodoxy
of
''
.
but
there
are
scholars
who
believe
that
prakrit
is
older
than
sanskrit
and
it
is
on
the
base
of
prakrit(original
)
the
language
sanskrit(refined
)
was
made
.
this
also
is
in
tune
with
the
jain
religion
where
the
first
tirthankar
is
adinath
himself
.
the
prakrits
became
literary
languages
,
generally
patronized
by
kings
identified
with
the
kshatriya
caste
,
but
were
regarded
as
illegitimate
by
the
brahmin
orthodoxy
.
the
various
prakrit
languages
are
associated
with
different
patron
dynasties
,
with
different
religions
and
different
literary
traditions
,
as
well
as
different
regions
of
the
indian
subcontinent
.
for
a
number
of
years
the
support
for
these
theories
was
evenly
divided
.
since
the
discovery
of
the
cosmic
microwave
background
in
1965
it
has
been
regarded
as
the
best
theory
of
the
origin
and
evolution
of
the
cosmos
.
before
the
late
1960s
,
many
cosmologists
thought
the
infinitely
dense
singularity
at
the
starting
time
of
friedmann
's
cosmological
model
was
a
mathematical
over
-
idealization
,
and
that
the
universe
was
contracting
before
entering
the
hot
dense
state
and
starting
to
expand
again
.
this
led
the
majority
of
cosmologists
to
accept
the
big
bang
,
in
which
the
universe
we
observe
began
a
finite
time
ago
.
before
the
ha'penny
bridge
had
been
built
there
were
seven
ferries
that
operated
from
one
side
of
the
liffey
to
the
other
under
the
watchful
eye
of
william
walsh
.
the
ferries
had
been
said
to
be
in
a
bad
condition
and
he
was
told
that
he
had
to
either
fix
the
ferries
or
build
a
bridge
.
walsh
chose
the
latter
option
and
was
granted
the
right
to
extract
a
ha'penny
toll
from
anyone
crossing
it
for
100
years
.
the
phunk
junkeez
were
one
of
many
bands
to
jump
on
the
band
wagon
in
the
early
90
's
that
fused
a
number
of
different
styles
in
their
music
,
from
hardcore
punk
to
trip
-
hop
.
phunk
junkeez
concerts
often
attracted
the
attention
of
local
police
who
threatened
to
throw
the
band
in
jail
.
the
band
grew
large
enough
to
start
playing
legitimate
venues
,
such
as
the
electric
ballroom
,
club
rio
,
mesa
amphitheater
,
and
compton
terrace
,
sometimes
selling
out
multiple
nights
at
some
of
these
venues
.
however
while
roachclip
is
the
original
dj
,
his
position
was
added
after
the
band
had
been
together
for
several
years
,
the
band
had
already
gained
its
notorioty
before
roachclip
joined
,
as
proclaimed
by
soulman
in
a
1992
interview
with
phoenix
new
times
.
such
views
make
the
'
singularist
assumption
'
,
that
every
plural
predication
is
at
its
root
a
singular
predication
,
thus
making
it
possible
to
apply
the
framework
of
standard
first
-
order
logic
.
no
set
ever
surrounds
a
building
,
though
its
members
may
.
the
fact
that
some
individuals
are
surrounding
a
building
does
not
automatically
imply
that
some
single
individual
(
of
any
kind
)
surrounds
the
building
.
plural
noun
phrases
can
refer
to
several
things
.
pikmin
come
in
several
colors
,
each
with
their
own
strengths
and
weaknesses
.
the
first
species
introduced
are
purple
pikmin
,
who
move
slower
than
normal
pikmin
,
but
have
ten
times
the
strength
and
weight
of
other
pikmin
,
giving
them
the
ability
to
pick
up
much
heavier
objects
and
attack
and
destroy
obstacles
and
other
enemies
with
fewer
numbers
.
white
pikmin
are
themselves
immune
to
poison
,
can
locate
buried
treasure
with
their
special
eyes
,
and
can
run
faster
than
other
pikmin
.
the
only
way
to
"
keep
"
them
is
if
they
are
transformed
into
other
pikmin
species
with
candypop
buds
.
the
name
is
probably
derived
from

(

there
is
some
controversy
surrounding
boyington
's
avg
victory
claims
.
boyington
also
felt
that
the
avg
staff
wrongly
calculated
claims
from
a
raid
on
chiang
mai
,
thailand
.
six
pilots
were
involved
in
a
raid
that
supposedly
destroyed
15
japanese
aircraft
on
the
ground
,
giving
each
man
2.5
victory
credits
for
the
raid
.
boyington
apparently
decided
that
the
two
pilots
who
flew
top
cover
should
not
have
shared
in
the
bounty
,
though
it
was
often
the
case
that
when
a
pilot
was
shot
down
victory
credits
were
equally
shared
among
all
taking
part
in
the
raid

in

when

public
school
system
banned
the

nativity
scenes

but
allowed
religious
symbols
of
hanukkah

be
displayed

defenders
of

policy
justified
it
in
claiming
that
the
symbols
in
question
,
the
hanukkah
menorah
and
muslim
star
and
crescent
,
were
cultural
,
but
that
the
nativity
scene
was
religious
,
thus
not
allowed
.
such
a
policy
angered
many
,
including

,
who
in

said
such
a
policy
was

in
general
,
cross
-
age
mentoring
programs
can
involve
a
tutoring
or
teaching
component
,
personal
mentorship
and
guidance
,
or
both
,
and
maintains
many
of
the
advantages
inherent
in
other
forms
of
peer
mentorship
.
because
student
mentors
are
closer
in
age
,
knowledge
,
authority
and
cognitive
development
than
adult
mentors
,
mentorees
often
feel
freer
to
express
ideas
,
ask
questions
,
and
take
risks
.
these
similarities
also
make
it
easier
for
mentors
to
understand
personal
and
academic
problems
that
the
mentoree
may
be
experiencing
,
and
present
solutions
in
a
more
understandable
and
relevant
way
.
the
specific
benefits
of
cross
-
age
mentoring/tutoring
are
numerous
,
and
are
briefly
described
here
in
three
main
categories
:
increased
academic
achievement
,
improved
interpersonal
skills
,
and
personal
development
.
the
extent
of
spinal
paralysis
depends
on
the
region
of
the
cord
affected
,
which
may
be
cervical
,
thoracic
,
or
lumbar
.
the
virus
may
affect
muscles
on
both
sides
of
the
body
,
but
more
often
the
paralysis
is
asymmetrical
.
any
limb
or
combination
of
limbs
may
be
affected—one
leg
,
one
arm
,
or
both
legs
and
both
arms
.
paralysis
is
often
more
severe
proximally
(
where
the
limb
joins
the
body
)
than
distally
(
the
fingertips
and
toes
)

however
,
some

do

thus

it
would

the

:

became
known

that
savage
punched
hogan
in
the
face
just
prior
to

causing
hogan
to
have
a
swollen
eye
during
the
event

the
story
was
found
to
be
untrue
.
wwe
(
then

said
that
hogan
's
swollen
eye
was
due
to
a
jet

ski
accident
.
he
was
subsequently
suspended
indefinitely
from
the

by

was
atypical
,
as
the
school
usually
waits
for
the

process
to
play
out
before
making
a

,
but
the

took
swift
action
because
of
the
severity
of

charge

because
there
were
many
people
upset
over

being
allowed
to
remain
on

keep

two
petitions
totaling
over
3,000

handling
of
the
case

amid

the
suit
alleges
that

is
defective
because
it
has
not
been
sufficiently
rigorous
in
determining
that

a
permit
will
best
serve
public
interest
,
as
demonstrated
by
a
lack
of
documented
scientific
studies
by
the
dnr
and
by
a
lack
of
public
review
and
input
,
prior
to
issuing
routine
permits

a
declaration
by

of
the
plaintiffs
references
the
commentary
on
article
viii
on

resources
of

,
1955
;
"
as
requirements
change

which
were
widely
assumed
to
discourage
offenses
from

rather
than

most
of

in

,
the

on

the
gendarmerie
is
the
direct
descendant
of
the
marshalcy
of
the
ancien
regime
,
more
commonly
known
by
its
french
title
,
the
maréchaussée
.
the
military
policing
responsibilities
of
the
marshal
of
france
were
delegated
to
the
marshal
's
provost
,
whose
force
was
known
as
the
marshalcy
because
its
authority
ultimately
derived
from
the
marshal
.
the
marshalcy
dates
back
to
the
hundred
years
war
,
and
some
historians
trace
it
back
to
the
early
twelfth
century
.
during
the
revolutionary
period
,
marshalcy
commanders
generally
placed
themselves
under
the
local
constitutional
authorities
.
the
freedom
allowed
by
using
computer

generated
imagery
allows
pornographic
(
erotic
)
artists
to
create
scenes
or
scenarios
that
would
not
be
possible
(
or
legal
)
within
the
realm
of
live
action
shooting
.
therefore
,
many
poser
pornographic
artists
choose
to
create
fantastical
scenes
that
may
feature
animals
,
monsters
,
aliens
,
magical
or
supernatural
elements
or
far
-
fetched
bdsm
scenarios
.
violent
and
disturbing
imagery
may
also
be
seen
in

unlike
a
unitary
state
,
sovereignty
is
constitutionally
split
between
at
least
two
territorial
levels
so
that
units
at
each
level
have
final
authority
and
can
act
independently
of
the
others
in
some
area
.
the
allocation
of
authority
between
the
sub
-
unit
and
centre
may
vary
.
typically
the
centre
has
powers
regarding
defence
and
foreign
policy
,
but
sub
-
units
may
also
have
international
roles
.
the
sub

units
may
also
participate
in
central

making

the
word
"
gremlin
"
originated
in
oral
use
amongst
r.a.f.
aviators
'
slang
in
malta
,
the
middle
east
and
india
and
is
said
to
date
to
1923
;
with
the
earliest
recorded
printed
use
being
a
poem
published
in
the
journal
'
aeroplane
'
april
10
,
1929
.
the
concept
of
gremlins
as
responsible
for
sabotaging
aircraft
was
popularized
during
world
war
ii
among
airmen
of
britain
's
royal
air
force
,
in
particular
the
men
of
the
high
altitude
photographic
reconnaissance
units
(
pru
)
of
raf
benson
,
raf
wick
and
raf
st
eval
.
the
story
attempted
to
explain
the
accidents
which
often
occurred
during
their
flights
.
gremlins
were
also
thought
to
have
enemy
sympathies
,
but
investigation
revealed
that
the
enemy
also
had
similar
problems
,
so
the
gremlins
were
not
taking
sides
in
the
conflict
.
}
}
in
reality
,
the
gremlins
were
a
form
of
"
buck
passing
"
or
deflecting
blame
.
the
teams
may
also
present
a
decision
calculus
for
the
judge
to
decide
the
case
:
for
instance
,
they
may
insist
that
the
judge
examine
the
case
in
a
deontological
rather
than
consequentialist
framework
.
a
deontological
framework
implies
that
the
judge
should
examine
certain
impacts
or
actions
of
the
case
before
other
impacts
.
in
other
words
,
as
long
as
something
good
comes
of
an
action
,
anything
bad
done
on
the
way
does
n't
matter
.
an
example
would
be
if
one
team
says
that
the
judge
must
prevent
famine
before
anything
else
but
the
other
team
says
that
they
prevent
more
deaths
and
that
is
what
the
judge
should
vote
on
,
no
matter
how
those
deaths
happened
.
powerlifting
,
in
most
federations
,
involves
three
events
:
squat
,
bench
press
and
deadlift
.
some
variations
of
this
are
found
at
some
meets
such
"
push
-
pull
only
"
meets
where
lifters
only
compete
in
the
bench
press
and
deadlift
,
with
the
bench
press
coming
first
and
the
deadlift
after
.
single
lift
meets
are
often
held
,
sometimes
alongside
a
normal
3-lift
event
.
this
is
most
common
in
the
bench
press
.
the
soft
engine
mounts
made
the
clutch
difficult
for
an
inexperienced
driver
to
operate
smoothly
.
the
unusual
engine
had
an
unusual
sound
that
led
some
people
to
think
it
was
a
two
stroke
.
light
bulbs
burned
out
often
,
giving
the
impression
that
the
company
had
gone
too
far
in
cutting
costs
.
it
had
no
steering
wheel
lock
but
,
in
the
u.
s.
,
its
unusual
controls
appeared
to
make
it
almost
theft
proof
.
this
made
them
all
easy
to
find
,
but
one
could
confuse
the
turn
signal
and
high
beam
motions
.
lubrication
required
a
more
versatile
lift
than
was
available
in
many
gas
stations
,
at
that
time
.
it
was
always
cited
as
the
example
of
car
aerodynamics
(
though
the
kamm
principle
was
not
yet
used
)
.
there
are
various
styles
of
porches
,
all
of
which
depend
on
the
architectural
tradition
of
its
location
.
however
,
they
may
be
larger
.
verandahs
,
for
example
,
are
usually
quite
large
and
may
encompass
the
entire
facade
as
well
as
the
sides
of
a

.
at
the
other
extreme
,
the
grand
hotel
on
mackinac
island
,
michigan
has
the
longest
porch
in
the
world
at
in
length
.
it
was
more
expensive
than
the
original
playstation
,
colored
black
instead
of
the
usual
gray
,
and
most
importantly
,
came
with
tools
and
instructions
that
allowed
a
user
to
be
able
to
program
playstation
games
and
applications
without
the
need
for
a
full
developer
suite
,
which
cost
many
times
the
amount
of
a
playstation
and
was
only
available
to
approved
video
game
developers
.
naturally
,
the
net
yaroze
lacked
many
of
the
features
the
full
developer
suite
provided
.
the
amount
of
space
may
seem
small
,
but
games
like
ridge
racer
ran
entirely
from
the
system
ram
(
except
for
the
streamed
music
tracks
)
.
it
would
not
however

,
commonly

the
mustelidae
is
a
diverse
family

the

partly
because

in

some
people
contend
(
backed
up
by
the
theory
of
risk
compensation
)
that
the
perception
of
safety
conferred
by
the

will
encourage

taking
.
the
partnership
for
safe
driving
is
among
those
concerned
that
esc
is
just
the
latest
example
of
a
long
and
ultimately
unsuccessful
campaign
,
in
the
u.s.
and
abroad
,
to
make
cars
that
are
capable
of
compensating
for
dangerous
driving
behavior
.
the
partnership
believes
that
if
no
corresponding
effort
is
made
to
deter
speeding
,
aggressive
,
distracted
and
drowsy
driving
,
this
technology
will
not
live
up
to
its
promise
and
may
,
in
fact
,
encourage
even
more
dangerous
driving
behavior
.
the
counter
-
argument
is
that
most
road
users
do
not
understand
these
systems
and
hence
just
drive
as
they
normally
would

work

in
it
he
described
how
they
subjected
the
common
people
and
rode
them
"
as
if
they
were
beasts
"
.
his
most
comprehensive
work
,
written
around
1443
and
one
of
his
last
,
was
'
the
net
of
faith
'
.
in
it
he
showed
how
the
apostles
treated
all
people
as
equals
,
and
considered
christ
as
the
only
head
.
in
the
early
church
,
mass
was
normally
celebrated
by
the
bishop
,
with
other
clergy
.
in
the
roman
rite
this
evolved
into
a
form
of
solemn
high
mass
celebrated
by
a
bishop
accompanied
by
a
deacon
,
subdeacon
,
thurifer
,
acolyte(s
)
and
other
ministers
,
under
the
guidance
of
a
priest
acting
as
master
of
ceremonies
.
most
often
the
specific
parts
assigned
to
deacon
and
subdeacon
are
performed
by
priests
.
the
parts
to
be
said
aloud
are
all
chanted
,
except
that
the
prayers
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
,
which
before
the
reform
of
pope
pius
v
were
said
in
the
sacristy
or
during

entrance
procession

times
,
dogs
,
usually
large
ancient
mastiff

type
breeds
,
would
be
strapped
with
armor
and
spiked
collars
,
and
sent
into
battle
to
attack
the
enemy
.
this
strategy
was
used
by
various
civilizations
,
such
as
the
romans
and
the
greeks
.
this
approach
has
been
largely
abandoned
in
modern
day
militaries
due
to
the
fact
that
modern
weapons
would
allow
the
dogs
to
be
destroyed
almost
immediately
,

on

when

soldiers
quickly
eliminated

:

the

in

elevate
those
,

in

his

were
almost
polar
opposites
of
those
held
by
the
new
conservative
leader
in
1964
,
edward
heath
,
who
remarked
of
williams
in
1966
:
"
i
thoroughly
disagree
with
his

they
are
not
the
view
of

modern

party

nor
the
views
of
the
great
majority
of
people
in
this
country
.
"
to
some
of
us
outside

it
appears
to
be
neither

an

we
must
oppose

not
condone
it

it

sense
for

the

but
is
inappropriate
for

because
they
store
a
legacy
lan

splits
the

into
two
seven

for

the
position

north
at

somewhat
arbitrary
;

many

,
such
as
medieval

,
polar
maps
,

the

that
north

(

(
since

money
was
already
banished
in

wellstone
was
presumably
worried
mainly
about
money
from

hugh

denied
this

claimed
that
after

out
several

had
left
a
bible
reading

read

commented

popular
use

as

outdoor
wear
has
spread
through
much
of

,

common
in

driscoll
has
not
published
a
comprehensive
outline
of
his
theological
beliefs
(
such
as
a
systematic
theology
)
,
but
his
sermons
,
lectures
,
and
books
provide
a
good
understanding
of
what
he
believes
.
furthermore
,
it
can
be
inferred
that
the
doctrinal
statement
of
the
church
planting
network
he
co
-
founded
,
,
is
a
reliable
overview
of
his
beliefs
.
in
summary
,
he
has
described
himself
as
(
in
order
of
importance
)
"
first
christian
,
second
evangelical
,
third
missional
,
and
fourth
reformed
.

the

time
and
can
not
issue
commands
to
another
disk
until
the
command
queue
has
been
completed
for
the
current
transactions
.
this
means
that
the
full
bandwidth
of
the
link
will
most
likely
not
be
used
.
this
kind
of
switching
is
therefore
used
when
capacity
is
the
major
concern
not
performance
.
in
the
past
wealthy
landowners
often
had
pigeon
houses
and
kept
pigeons
.
however
,
the
flavor
of
the
meat
of
the
birds
was
prized
by
many
people
and
so
organized
commercial
enterprises
marketing
squab
meat
arose
.
ten
pairs
of
pigeons
can
produce
eight
squabs
each
month
without
being
fed
especially
by
the
pigeon
keepers
.
for
a
greater
yield
,
commercially
raised
squab
may
be
produced
in
a
two

nest
system
,
where
the
mother
lays
two
new
eggs
in

nest

squabs
are
still
growing
in
the
first
nest
,
fed
by
their
father

establishing
two
breeding
lines
has
also
been
suggested
as
a
strategy
,
where
one
breeding
line
is
selected
for
prolificacy

the
other
is
selected
for
"

moon
's
works
have
come
in
for
criticism
from
some
reviewers
.
in
many
of
his
books
,
he
has
stated
that
he
writes
history
from
the
perspective
of
those
involved
at
the
time
,
and
not
with
the
historian
's
benefit
of
hindsight
.
the
result
is
that
some
of
his
conclusions
differ
from
what
later
analyses
of
events
reveal
.
some
describe
it
as
engaging
,

denounce
it

in
response
,

his

claimed
that

that

of

harshest
criticisms

since

it
has
seen
use

areas

this
,
where

are
cut

often
have

it

have
perforations

therefore
,
the

may

with
a
residual
position
in

there
is
a
chance
that
the
price
of
the
underlier
may
gap
adversely
,
resulting
in
an
unanticipated
loss
to
the
writer
.
in

the
clinton
problem
:
the
clinton
administration
had
presided
over
an
economic
boom
and
the
balancing
of
the
federal
budget
.
normally
,
a
vice
president
running
under
such
circumstances
would
have
played
up
his
connection
to
the
administration
.
clinton
's
personal
scandals
,
however
,
made
that
approach
more
problematic
for
gore
.
it
has
been
suggested
that
he
should
have
involved
clinton
much
more
heavily
in
his
campaign
considering
president
clinton
's
approval
ratings
were
in
the
high
60s
throughout

and
that
clinton
had
helped
democrats
pick
up
seats
in
congress
in
the
1998
midterm
elections
,
in
which
democrats
made
significant
gains
;
others
have
said
that
he
should
have
done
more
to
distance
himself
from
clinton
.
the
lieberman
problem
:
gore
's
choice
of
moderate
senator
joe
lieberman
as
his
running
mate
alienated
many
of
those
on
the
left
of
the
democratic
party
.
many
voters
who
otherwise
may
have
supported
gore
turned
to
the
green
party
candidate
,
ralph
nader
.
however
,
if
gore
had
chosen
a
strongly
liberal
running
mate
,
many
moderate
voters
might
have
swung
to
george
w.
bush
.
some
have
speculated
that
lieberman
's
jewish
religious
affiliation
may
have
alienated
some
voters
,
and
caused
them
to
vote
for
bush
;
however
,
lieberman
's
orthodox
and
public
religiousity
may
have
attracted
conservative
christian
voters
.
while
it
can
be
said
that
lieberman
invited
support
from
the
jewish
population
,
many
believe
it
would
not
have
made
a
difference
if
a
gentile
was
selected
as
gore
's
running
mate
,
as
jews
historically
have
favored
the
democrats
.
gore
's
personality
:
much
attention
was
paid
to
gore
's
audible
sighing
while
bush
was
answering
questions
in
the
first
of
the
bush/gore
debates
.
cnn
instant
polls
immediately
following
this
debate
found
that
viewers
felt
gore
had
won
by
a
narrow
margin
.
twenty
-
two
voters
were
interviewed
by
cnn
,
and
none
of
them
volunteered
comments
on
gore
's
behavior
(
'
cnn
'
,
october
3
2000
)
.
when
asked
by
conservative
frank
luntz
of
the
msnbc
channel
,
an
equal
number
of
viewers
were
troubled
by
gore
's
sighs
and
bush
's
repeated
invocations
of
"
fuzzy
math
"
(
see
george
w.
bush
)
.
some
liberals
conclude
that
the
observation
of
gore
's
alleged
personality
flaws
seems
to
have
originated
with
(
and
been
propagated
by
)
conservative
news
organizations
.
regardless
of
voters
'
original
reactions
,
however
,
subsequent
press
coverage
concentrated
heavily
on
gore
's
sighs
and
other
perceived
flaws
,
with
some
conservatives
coining
the
moniker
,
"
al
bore
"
.
gore
's
behavior
during
the
first
debate
was
even
the
basis
for
a
sketch
on
nbc
's
'
saturday
night
live
'
television
program
,
which
according
to
some
sources
,
members
of
gore
's
campaign
asked
him
to
watch
before
the
next
debate
.
whether
or
not
he
watched
the
sketch
,
his
behavior
was
noticeably
subdued
in
the
second
debate
.
on

day
,
gore
himself
would
appear
on
a

'
prime

to
make
a
few
jokes
about
this
behavior
.
perceived
artificiality
and
lack
of
candor
:
in
1997
,
after
it
came
to
light
that
gore
had
improperly
used
white
house
telephones
to
raise
money
for
the
campaign
in
1996
,
gore
defended
himself
awkwardly
during
a
press
conference
in
which
his
denial
featured
repetition
of
the
phrase
"
no
controlling
legal
authority
"
;
likewise
,
when
a
scandal
broke
concerning
gore
's
appearance
at
hsi
lai
temple
at
an
event
where
unlawful
campaign
donations
were
laundered
through
buddhist
nuns
,
gore
said
he
thought
the
event
was
"
community
outreach
"
.
the
"
no
controlling
legal
authority
"
example
illustrates
the
vice
-
president
's
manner
of
speaking
generally
,
which
was
easy
to
caricature
as
stilted
,
pompous
,
and
condescending
,
unlike
the
folksy
but
intelligent
intimacy
that
was
the
hallmark
of
president
clinton
's
style
.
populist
rhetoric
:
gore
ran
on
a
somewhat
more
populist
platform
than
his
predecessor
clinton
.
although
gore
supported
trade
liberalization
and
many
other
clinton
-
like
reforms
,
he
also
used
rhetoric
that
drew
attention
to
growing
gaps
between
rich
and
poor
in
american
society
.
some
found
this
language
divisive
;
however
,
the
notion
that
this
position
hurt
his
popularity
is
challenged
by
the
fact
that
his
poll
numbers
went
up
substantially
shortly
after
his
strongly
populist
speech
on
august
16
,
2000
at
the
democratic
national
convention
in
los
angeles
.
after
the
loss
,
lieberman
even
criticized
gore
for
adopting
a
populist
theme
during
their
campaign
,
and
stated
he
had
objected
to
gore
's
"
people
vs.
the
powerful
"
message
,
believing
it
was
not
the
best
strategy
for
democrats
to
use
to
win
the
election
.
the
republicans
'
"
solid
south
"
:
gore
,
a
southerner
himself
,
had
won
every
election
he
had
ever
run
in
the
south
before
the
2000
election
.
however
,
between
the
time
that
clinton
and
gore
were
first
elected
in
1992
,
many
democrats
changed
parties
,
due
to
the
growing
conservative
base
in
the
region
.
although
gore
would
have
won
the
election
if
he
had
won
virtually
any
other
state
in
the
union
,
many
attribute
his
loss
to
his
failure
to
win
any
southern
state
,
including
his
native
tennessee
.
ralph
nader
:
a
common
water
cooler
theory
about
gore
's
loss
centers
around
ralph
nader
's
surprisingly
high
standing
in
the
final
polls
of
the
election
.
a
number
of
gore
supporters
accused
nader
of
running
as
a
spoiler
candidate
,
allegedly
drawing
far

liberal
voters
from
gore
,
whether
intentionally
or
not

most
stamps
collected
from

in

generate

for

the

,
it

however
,
mexican

are
said
to
be
more
solid

one
important
aspect
of
kuhn
's
paradigms
is
that
the
paradigms
are
incommensurable
,
which
means
that
two
paradigms
can
not
be
reconciled
with
each
other
because
they
can
not
be
subjected
to
the
same
measure
or
common
standard
of
comparison
.
that
is
,
no
meaningful
comparison
between
them
is
possible
without
fundamental
modifications
in
the
concepts
which
are
part
of
the
paradigms
being
compared
.
this
way
of
looking
at
the
concept
of
"
paradigm
"
creates
a
paradox
of
sorts
,
since
competing
paradigms
are
in
fact
constantly
being
compared
with
each
other
.
this
definition
makes
it
clear
that
the
real
barrier
to
comparison
is
not
necessarily
the
absence
of
common
units
of
measure
,
but
an
absence
of
mutually
compatible
or
mutually
intelligible
concepts

"
most
sociologists
,
criminologists
and
even
some

believe
the

social
conflicts

thus
prefer
the
term

does
,
that
a

psychological
,

rouse

commonly
referred

romantic
composer

of

the
exact
nature
of
the
flower
wars
is
not
well
determined
but
a
number
of
different
interpretations
of
the
concept
exist
.
the
widely
accepted
idea
of
the
flower
wars
is
that
it
was
a
special
institutionalized
kind
of
warfare
where
two
enemy
states
would
plan
battles
through
mutual
arrangement
in
order
to
satisfy
the
religious
needs
of
both
combatants
for
war
captives
to
use
in
sacrificial
rituals
,
but
also
,
possibly
,
to
train
young
warriors
and
enable
social
mobility
which
for
the
lower
classes
was
primarily
possible
through
military
service
.
this
view
is
based
on
a
number
of
quotes
from
early
chroniclers
and
also
from
the
letters
of
cortés
.
however
in
recent
years
this
interpretation
has
been
doubted
by
scholars
such
as
nigel
davies
see
davies
(
1968
)
for
an
advancement
of
this
interpretation
and
ross
hassig
hassig
(
1988
)
.
,
who
argues
that
"
the
mutual
arrangement
"
of
the
flower
war
institution
is
dubious
,
and
suggest
that
flowery
war
was
in
fact
a
low
-
intensity
,
sustained
conflict
with
the
aztec
side
trying
to
fatigue
the
tlaxcalteca
in
order
to
later
conquer
them
entirely
.
meanwhile
the
people
were
elaborating
a
ballad
poetry
of
their
own
,
the
body
of
which
is
known
as
the
'
romanceiro
'
.
it
consists
of
lyrico
-
narrative
poems
treating
of
war
,
chivalry
,
adventure
,
religious
legends
,
and
the
sea
,
many
of
which
have
great
beauty
and
contain
traces
of
the
varied
civilizations
which
have
existed
in
the
peninsula
.
when
the
court
poets
had
exhausted
the
artifices
of
provencal
lyricism
,
they
imitated
the
poetry
of
the
people
,
giving
it
a
certain
vogue
which
lasted
until
the
classical
renaissance
.
it
was
then
thrust
into
the
background
,
and
though
cultivated
by
a
few
,
it
remained
unknown
to
men
of
letters
until
the
nineteenth
century
,
when
almeida
-
garrett
began
his
literary
revival
and
collected
folk
poems
from
the
mouths
of
the
peasantry
.
there
is
some
controversy
as
to
how
best
classify
the
reports
on
the
night
in
question
.
some
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
differing
nature
of
the
eyewitness
reports
indicates
that
several
unidentified
objects
were
in
the
area
,
each
of
which
was
its
own
separate
'
event
.
'
this
is
largely
dismissed
by
skeptics
as
an
over
-
extrapolation
from
standard
deviation
common
in
necessarily
subjective
eye
-
witness
accounts
.
the
media
and
most
skeptical
investigators
have
largely
preferred
to
split
the
sightings
into
two
distinct
classes
-
a
first
and
second
event
-
for
which
two
separate
explanations
are
offered
:
the
epithet
"
war
on
drugs
"
has
been
condemned
as
being
propaganda
to
justify
military
or
paramilitary
operations
under
the
guise
of
a
noble
cause
;
in
particular
,
noam
chomsky
points
out
that
the
term
is
an
example
of
synecdoche
referring
to
operations
against
suspected
producers
,
traders
and/or
users
of
certain
substances
.
this
form
of
language
is
similar
to
that
used
in
other
initiatives
such
as
lyndon
b.
johnson
's
"
war
on
poverty
"
and
george
w.
bush
's
"
war
on
terrorism
"
.
the
word
"
war
"
is
used
to
invoke
a
state
of
emergency
,
although
the
target
of
the
war
is
n't
anything
against
which
standard
military
tactics
are
effective
.

,
just

received
an
honorary
doctorate
degree
,
ph
.
d.
from
a
board
university
of
alternative
medicines
located
in
boston
massachusetts
.
joel
was
recognized
by
the
board
due
to
his
ministry
work
,
for
his
much
noted
generous
help
to
people
in
need
,
and
for
his
steadfast
commitment
in
helping
millions
of
people
through

best
seller
books
.
the
choice
of
other
members
of
this
commission
was
not
random
,
it
contained
wealthy
king
supporters
,
like
the
merchant
and
owner
of
a
merchant
fleet
from
danzig
,
georg
hewel
(
gdańsk
,
jerzy
hewel
)
.
because
the
sejm
(
polish
diet
)
was
at
best
reluctant
to
pay
for
new
ships
and
royal
chest
was
permanently
empty
it
was
due
to
hewel
that
the
new
fleet
was
created
at
all
.
he
gave
to
the
king
's
disposal
10
ships
,
a
few
of
them
were
carrying
small
caliber
cannons
.
additionally
the
king
wanted
to
build
a
few
galleons
in
danzig
and
puck
and
because
of
long
construction
times
,
also
to
purchase
a
few
ships
abroad
,
but
those
plans
were
not
realized
(
except
of
purchase
of
one
danish
ship
-
requiring
quite
serious
repair
)
.
the
name
however
stuck
to
many
languages
and
has
caused
some
confusion
even
among
linguists
working
with
native
american
languages
.
this
confusion
prompted
some
kind
of
distinction
between
popoluca
languages
and
the
spelling
"
popoluca
"
with
an
"
u
"
became
used
for
certain
mixe
-
zoquean
languages
,
while
the
spelling
"
popoloca
"
with
an
"
o
"
became
used
for
certain
languages
of
the
popolocan
family
of
oto
-
manguean
languages
.
some
indigenous
communities
speaking
languages
called
popoluca
feel
that
this
name
is
unfairly
given
and
carries
a
derogatory
meaning
and
they
prefer
other
names
to
be
used
about
them
.
below
is
a
list
of
different
varieties
of
popoluca
and
popoloca
and
the
alternative
names
that
are
now
beginning
to
be
used
for
them
,
at

in

technical

governmental
publications

funding

complex
process
to

scientists
comment
that
'
the
biggest
hurdle
is
regulatory
'
,
whereas
an
official
view
is
that
individual

would
need
proof
individually
because
it
would
be
too
complicated
to
do
as
a
combination
,
with
many
variables

the
specificity

,
essentialism
is
the
idea
that
certain
concepts
may
be
expressed
organically
in
certain
media
.
a
chase
scene
,
for
example
,
may
be
appropriate
for
motion
pictures
,
but
poorly
realized
in
poetry
,
because
the
essential
components
of
the
poetic
medium
are
ill
suited
to
convey
the
information
of
a
chase
scene
.
this
idea
may
be
further
refined
,
and
it
may
be
said
that
the
haiku
is
a
poor
vehicle
for
describing
a
lover
's
affection
,
as
opposed
to
the
more
organically
correct

,
working

accept
some
form
of
the
concept
of
organic
form
(
although
philosophers

added
support

health
speculation
in
later
years
a
medical
mishap
would
change
the
course
of
eden
’s
life
forever
.
during
an
operation
in
1953
to
remove
eden
’s
gallstones
,
the
surgeon
damaged
his
bile
duct
.
this
blunder
made
eden
vulnerable
to
recurrent
infections
and
attacks
of
violent
pain
and
fevers
.
to
overcome
this
weakness
eden
was
prescribed
the
wonder
drug
of
the
1950s
-
benzedrine
.
regarded
by
doctors
in
the
1950s
as
a
harmless
stimulant
,
it
belongs
to
the
family
of
drugs
called
amphetamines
–
the
illegal
drug
we
now
call
speed
.
during
this
time
amphetamines
were
prescribed
and
used
in
a
very
casual
way
.
it
has
been
widely
suggested
that
eden

affected

to

clients
sit
facing
directly
across
a
table
from
each
other
,
while
the
mediator
sits
at
a
distance
from
both
.
this
assures
that
both
parties
must
address
each

,
directly
.
parties
often
must
be
reminded
that
the
mediator
is
there
to
help
the
parties
take
responsibility
for
managing
their
own
conflict
,
rather
than
to
judge
between
the
merits
of
the
position
of
one
party
or
the
other

changed

somewhat
surprisingly
,
the

remains

these

the
term
dark

is
no

because
of
the
difficulty

the

(
"

other
terms

passed
the

he
has
observed
that
though
racism
has
been
extant
in
numerous
contexts

it
began
in
america
as
a
business
proposition
:
slavery
.
in
two
anecdotes
relating
to
raisin
in
the
sun
,
he
points
out
that
back
in
1959
,
the
year
the
play
was
first
produced
,
there
was
a
man
seated
in
the
best
seat
in
the
house
(
fourth
row
center
)
.
this
man
preferred
to
stand
at
the
back
of
the
theater
for
the
entire
performance
rather
than
in
the
best
seat
in

house
situated

interesting
commentary
on

irrationality
of
prejudice
.
the

,
along
with

there

went
home

kept
fighting
to
keep

out

he
then
explained
the
cause
of
such
differences
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
cause
and
effect
.
these
limitations
make
least
privilege
substantially
less
effective
than
the
enforcement
or
the
precise
set
of
least
privileges
would
suggest
.
that
is
not
to
suggest
one
should
n't
try
,
it
does
help
.
the
point
is
that
analysis
and
enforcement
of
least
privilege
is
more
involved
than
it
first
appears
and
we
should
not
assume
too
much
about

december
1955
.
it
is
based
on
'
the
unknown
soldier
'
,
a
novel
by
väinö
linna
.
the
story
is
about
the
continuation
war
between
finland
and
the
soviet
union
as
told
from
the
viewpoint
of
ordinary
finnish
soldiers
.
the
film
was
and
remains
the
most
successful
movie
ever
in
finland
;
about
2.8
million
people
,
or
more
than
half
the
finnish
population
,
saw
it
in
theaters
.
its
portrayal
of
linna
's
characters
is
widely
accepted
as
canonical
.
in
1985
rauni
mollberg
directed
a
new
version
of
the
film
.
the
other
characters
think
,
correctly
,
that
laurey
(
joan
roberts
)
and
curly
(
alfred
drake
)
are
in
love
.
in
this
song
they
warn
each
other
not
to
behave
indiscreetly
,
lest
people
misinterpret
their
intentions
.
neither
wants
to
admit
to
the
other
-
or
themselves
-
his
or
her
true
feelings
.
at
the
end
of
the
musical
the
characters
reprise
the
number
after
becoming
engaged
,
saying
"
let
people
say
we
're
in
love
.
"
the
term
'
phonograph
'
is
usually
restricted
to
devices
playing
cylinder
records
.
the
term
'
gramophone
'
would
generally
be
taken
to
refer
to
a
wind
-
up
machine
,
and
from
the
1960s
onwards
the
more
common
term
would
be
'
record
player
'
or
'
turntable
'
as
part
of
a
system
that
also
played
cassettes
and
included
radio
.
such
a
system
would
be
called
a
'
hi
-
fi
'
or
'
stereo
'
(
most
systems
being
stereophonic
by
the
mid-1960s
)
.
'
like
other
,
similar
devices
the
marketers
of
which
wanted
to
express
the
notion
of
"
sound
"
in
the
devices
'
names
,
they
also
used
the
same
part
of
the
greek
word
(
e.g.
,
telephone
,
microphone
etc
.
)
.
as
a
child
and
adolescent
he
had
a
number
of
run
-
ins
with
the
law
and
spent
several
months
in
jail
before
joining
a
band
of
traveling
minstrels
.
he
grew
in
fame
and
began
performing
in
several
regional
theaters
before
joining
john
hamlin
's
national
show
in
1878
.
he
continued
traveling
nationally
with
a
number
of
different
acts
,
eventually
joining
the
'
the
tin
soldier
'
in
1890
.
there
he
began
writing
many
prominently
featured
songs
which
led
him
to
begin
publishing
music
independently
.
however
,
during
this
time
he
made
some
cursory
attempts
to
sell
stories
,
including
submission
of
some
moon
knight
plots
to
denny
o’neill
,
but
his
efforts
were
unfruitful
.
although
crossing
over
from
sales
into
editorial
was
considered
a
conflict
of
interest
in
the
marvel
offices
,
owsley
,
whom
david
describes
as
a
"
maverick
"
,
was
impressed
with
how
david
had
not
previously
hesitated
to
work
with
him
when
owsley
was
an
assistant
editor
under
larry
hama
,
and
thus
,
when
he
became
an
editor
,
he
purchased
a
spider
-
man
story
from
david
,
which
appeared
in
'
spectacular
spider
-
man
'
#
103
in
1985
.
although
david
attributes
the
story
's
poor
sales
to
this
decision
,
such
crossing
over
from
sales
to
editorial
is
now
common
.
nonetheless
,
he
was
fired
from
'
spectacular
spider
-
man
'
by
owsley
due
to
editorial
pressure
by
marvel
's
editor
-
in
-
chief
jim
shooter
,
and
david
has
commented
that
the
resentment
stirred
by
owsley
's
purchase
of
his
stories
may
have
permanently
damaged
owsley
's
career

the
'

swamp
rat
'
(
'
rattus
lutreolus
'
)
is
a
species
of
rat
native
to
the
area
around
melbourne
.
they
currently
live
primarily
in
the
outer
urban
areas
east
of
melbourne
.
they
are
unrelated
to
black
or
brown
rats
and
are
not
problematic
.
the
swamp
rat
can
be
seen
at
places
like
the
healesville
sanctuary
,
where
they
live
in
the
grounds
.
the
rangers
at
healesville
tolerate
them
,
since
they
(
the
rats
)
are
native
to
the
area
and
carry
no
dangerous
diseases

elements
of
this
episode
generated
tremendous
controversy
among
fans
of
the
series
.
as
details
of
this
episode
emerged
,
fans
became
divided
in
their
views
of
what
could
be
the
final
televised
'
star
trek
'
episode
for
the
foreseeable
future
.
advance
criticisms
(
before
the
episode
was
actually
released
)
ranged
from
displeasure
over
the
fact
the
final
episode
would
be
written
by
the
unpopular
berman
and
braga
to
outrage
over
the
decision
to
tie
the
series
finale
into
'
star
trek
:
the
next
generation
'
.
the
dispersal
of
spores
is
different
from
most
"
typical
"
mushrooms
that
spread
their
spores
through
the
air
.
stinkhorns
instead
produce
a
sticky
spore
mass
on
their
tip
which
has
a
sharp
,
sickly
-
sweet
odor
of
carrion
to
attract
flies
and
other
insects
.
the
mature
fruiting
bodies
can
be
smelled
from
a
considerable
distance
in
the
woods
,
and
at
close
quarters
most
people
find
the
cloying
stink
extremely
repulsive
.
the
flies
land
in
the
gleba
and
in
doing
so
collect
the
spore
mass
on
their
legs
and
carry
it
to
other
locations
.

upbringing
by
cooperation
'
the
higher
level
of
communication
is
reached
when
a
parent
and
a
child
cooperate
in
achievement
of
the
common
goal
.
this
common
goal
can
be
a
challenging
project
.
however
some
popular
parental
discussions
about
money
and
things
have
nothing
to
do
with

he
also
states
that
"
no
one
from
the
outside
can
improve
relationships
between
two
people
.
"
america
’s
quarrel
was
never
with
the
russian
people
,
it
was
with
the
bolsheviks
who
terrorized
russia
and
said
to
americans
when
i
was
young
,
'
we
will
bury
you
!
"
he
believes
putin
is
probably
"
being
set
up
"
for
the
poisoning
of
alexander
litvinenko
,
and
that
litvenko
's
death
was
likely
either
a
suicide
or
the
work
of
one
of
putin
's
enemies
trying
to
"
put
a
cloud
of
suspicion
over
putin
and
a
chill
over
russian
relations
with
the
west
.
"
in
buchanan
's
view
,
both
russia
and
the
united
states
have
a
vital
interest
in
resisting
islamic
terrorism
and
the
possibility
of
chinese
expansionism
,
and
that
"
of
this
generation
of
leaders
,
it
may
be
said
in
epitaph
:
they
were
too
small
to
see
the
larger
world
.
they
frittered
away
in
a
decade
what
others
had
won
in

half

century
of
perseverance
in
the
cold

for
the
next
15
years
,
the
pathet
lao
ran
the
country
almost
as
a
vietnamese
colony
.
a
systematic
program
of
forcefully
removing
and
exterminating
hmong
people
was
begun
within
laos
,
which
resulted
in
complaints
by
united
nations
member
countries
of
attempted
genocide
and
other
human
rights
abuses
by
the
government
of
laos
.
the
lao
government
's
response
has
been
to
label
the
hmong

as
"

"

of

they
wished
to

thus
a
reader
who
submitted
a
large
number
of

increased
his

her
chances
of
winning

reduced
the
maximum
possible

it
can
be
shown
mathematically
that

average
winnings
in
this
game
by
submitting
a

equal
to
the
total
number

,
if

take
this
into

muller
went
to
bombay
(
now
mumbai
)
in
1911
,
then
considered
the
haven
of
art
in
india
.
he
won
the
gold
medal
from
the
bombay
art
society
in
the
same
year
.
he
travelled
a
lot
through
maharashtra
,
rajasthan
,
gujarat
and
in
the
himalayas
,
enjoying
the
patronage
of
various
royal
families
of
the
time
.
his
paintings
included
landscapes
,
portraits
and
scenes
from
the
life
of
the
maharajas
(
kings
)
,
historical
subjects
and
incidents
from
the
indian
hindu
epics
-
the
ramayana
and
the
mahabharata
.
his
paintings
have
been
acquired
by
the
buckingham
palace
,
london
,
the
south
kensington
museum
(
now
known
as
the
victoria
and

museum
)

museums
at

,

,
the
jodhpur
fort

the
royal
palace
at
jaipur
.
his
paintings
are
much
sought
after
and
have
surfaced
in
various
auctions
in
recent
years
.
the
actions
the
organization
actually
takes
may
often
vary
significantly
from
stated
policy
.
this
difference
is
sometimes
caused
by
political
compromise
over
policy
,
while
in
other
situations
it
is
caused
by
lack
of
policy
implementation
and
enforcement
.
implementing
policy
may
have
unexpected
results
,
stemming
from
a
policy
whose
reach
extends
further
than
the
problem
it
was
originally
crafted
to
address
.
additionally
,
unpredictable
results
may
arise
from
selective
or
idiosyncratic
enforcement
of
policy
.
ideophones
are
a
distinct
set
of
lexical
items
,
often
denoting
some
process
that
is
directly
perceived
by
the
senses
(
such
as
a
kind
of
sound
or
visual
experience
)
,
which
enter
into
a
special
range
of
language
-
specific
grammatical
patterns
.
nawat
is
one
of
many
languages
possessing
such
items
and
the
associated
patterns
,
which
in
this
case
are
'
expressive
'
verb
formations
.
the
root
form
of
a
typical
nawat
ideophone
is
a
cvcv
sequence
,
e.g.
'
-chala-
,
-china-
,
-kelu-
,
-kina-
,
-kumu-
,
-kwala-
,
-tapa-
,
-tikwi-
,
-tzaya-
,
-tzili-
,
-tzutzu-
'
.
these
roots
are
not
words
and
only
acquire
full
meaning
when
they
enter
into
one
or
another
of
the
derivational
patterns
for
nawat
ideophones
.
some
at
least
are
probably
onomatopoeic
in
origin
.
poilieve
argued
that
the
term
was
commonly
used
for
"
issues
that
stick
to
one
.
"
over
the
previous
years
,
the
term
itself
had
been
used
by
a
number
of
prominent
canadian
public
figures
to
indicate
a
sticky
situation
.
but
it
does
n't
mean
to
say
you
have
to
become
slavishly
connected
like
some
kind
of
"
tar
baby
"
with
them
.

“

mixing
tobacco
in
with
the
cannabis
is
much
more
common
in
some
areas
partly
because
the
majority
of
cannabis
is
resin
which
can
not
be
smoked
on
its
own
in
a
joint
.
people
who
use
tobacco
claim
it
helps
the
joint
burn
,
when
loose
tobacco
acts
as
"
kindling
"
to
ignite
the
moister
and
denser
cannabis
,
while
some
non
-
tobacco
smokers
claim
that
tobacco
destroys
the
cannabis
high
.
some
smokers
also
avoid
mixing
cannabis
with
tobacco
for
fear
of
becoming
addicted
to
tobacco
.
some
believe
that
heating
the
tobacco
before

gets
rid
of

other
unhealthy
substances

there
is
some
concern
by
news
photographers
that
the
profession
of
photojournalism
as
it
is
known
today
could
change
to
such
a
degree
that
it
is
unrecognizable
as
image

capturing
technology
naturally
progresses
.
citizen
journalism
and
the
increase
in
user
contribution
and
submission
of
amateur
photos
to
news
sites
is
becoming
more
widespread
.
however
,
the
widespread
use
of
cameras
as
a
way
of
reporting
news
did
not
come
until
the
advent
of
smaller
,
more
portable
cameras
that
used
the
enlargeable
film
negative
to
record
images
.
the
introduction
of
the
35
mm
leica
camera
in
the
1930
’s
made
it
possible
for
photographers
to
move
with
the
action
,
taking
shots
of
events
as
they
were
unfolding
.
there
is
a
debate
over
the
effectiveness
and
usefulness
of
caucuses
in
iowa
.
one
criticism
is
that
the
caucuses
,
especially
the
democratic
caucus
,
are
a
step
backwards
from
the
right
to
a
secret
ballot
.
democratic
caucus
participants
(
though
'
not
'
republicans
,
whose
caucuses
vote
by
secret
ballot
)
must
publicly
state
their
opinion
and
vote
,
leading
to
natural
problems
such
as
peer
pressure
from
fellow
neighbors
and
embarrassment
over
who
his/her
real
pick
might
be
.
another
criticism
involves
the
sheer
amount
of
participants
'
time
these
events
consume
.
the
iowa
caucus
lasts
two
hours
,
preventing
people
who
must
work
,
who
are
sick
,
or
must
take
care
of
their
children
from
casting
their
vote
.
absentee
voting
is
also
barred
,
so
soldiers
who
come
from
iowa
,
but
must
serve
in
the
military
lose
their
vote
.
the
final
criticism
is
the
complexity
of
the
rules
in
terms
of
how
one
's
vote
counts
,
as
it
is
not
a
simple
popular
vote
.
each
precinct
's
vote
may
be
weighed
differently
due
to
its
past
voting
record
.
ties
can
be
solved
by
picking
a
name
out
of
a
hat
or
a
simple
coin
toss
,
leading
to
anger
over
the
true
democratic
nature
of
these
caucuses
.
additionally
,
the
representation
of
the
caucus
has
been
questioned
due
to
traditionally
low
turnout
.
others
question
the
permanent
feature
of
having
caucuses
in
certain
states
,
while
perpetually
ignoring
the
rest
of
the
country
.

blurred

were
often
deadly

comical

-
enactments
of
those
they
read
about

this
romanticised
"
chivalric
revival
"
manifested
itself
in
a
number
of
ways
,
including
the
pas

,
round
table
and
'
emprise
'
(
or
'
empresa
'
,
enterprise
,
chivalrous
adventure
)
,
and
in
increasingly
elaborated
rules
of
courtesy
and
heraldry
.
for
example
,
a
person
who
lives
in

recently
,
it
's
been
alleged
that
dumesnil
de
glapion
was
so
in
love
with
marie
,
he
refused
to
live
separately
from
his
placée
according
to
racial
custom
.
in
an
unusual
decision
,
dumesnil
de
glapion
passed
as
a
man
of
color
in
order
to
live
with
her
under
respectable
circumstances
--
thus
explaining
the
confusion
many
historians
have
had
whether
he
was
truly
white
or
black
.
although
it
is
popularly
thought
that
marie
presented
dumesnil
de
glapion
with
fifteen
children
,
only
five
are
listed
in
vital
statistics
and
of
these
,
two
daughters
--
one
the
famous
marie
euchariste
or
marie
leveau
ii
--
lived
to
adulthood
.
marie
euchariste
closely
resembled
her
mother
and
startled
many
who
thought
that
marie
leveau
had
been
resurrected
by
the
black
arts
,
or
could
be
at
two
places
at
once
,
beliefs
that
the
daughter
did
little
to
correct
.
the
metropolitan
police
officers
were
unarmed
to
clearly
distinguish
them
from
military
enforcers
,
which
had
been
the
system
of
policing
seen
before
the
1820s
.
at
the
time
,
burglary
(
or
"
house
breaking
"
as
it
was
then
called
)
was
a
common
problem
for
police
,
and
house
breakers
were
usually
armed
,
as
it
was
then
legal
to
own
a
pistol
for
self
-
defence
.
because
of
many
deaths
of
officers
in
the
hands
of
firearms
in
the
outer
districts
of
the
metropolis
,
and
after
much
press
coverage
debating
whether
peel
's
service
should
be
fully
armed
,
the
commissioner
applied
to
the
home
secretary
to
supply
all
officers
on
the
outer
districts
with
revolvers
.
the
practice
lasted
until
1936
,
although
the
vast
majority
of
the
system
was
phased
out
by
the
end
of
the
19th
century
.

do

contain
any
overlap
in

material
with
themselves
or
with
the
'

'
collection
,
although
at
times
one
hears
some
recurring
themes
being
reworked
and
replayed
.
(
the
many
early
recordings
of
yahaghi
playing
with
a
singer
are
published
under
the

's
name
)
.
the
protection
of
photographs
in
this
manner
has
been
criticised
on
two
grounds
.
firstly
,
it
is
argued
that
photographs
should
not
be
protected
as
artistic
works
,
but
should
instead
be
protected
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
of
sound
recordings
and
films
.
in
other
words
,
copyright
should
not
protect
the
subject
matter
of
a
photograph
as
a
matter
of
course
as
a
consequence
of
a
photograph
being
taken
.
it
is
argued
that
protection
of
photographs
as
artistic
works
is
anomalous
,
in
that
photography
is
ultimately
a
medium
of
reproduction
,
rather
than
creation
.
for
example
,
michael
reichmann
describes
photography
as
an
art
of
disclosure
,
as
opposed
to
an
art
of
inclusion
.
secondly
,
it
is
argued
that
the
protection
of
photographs
as
artistic
works
leads
to
bizarre
results
.
for
example
,
it
is
possible
that
vogue
magazine
would
be
infringing
copyright
if
they
,
inspired
by
a
picture
taken
by
a
drunk
boyfriend
of
his
girlfriend
posing
provocatively
on
a
motorcycle
,
attempted
to
recreate
the
photograph
.
similarly
,
it
is
possible
that
a
famous
wildlife
photographer
,
inspired
by
a
cheap
snapshot
of
cheetah
at
the
zoo
,
on
flikr
,
would
be
infringing
copyright
if
he
went
exploring
the
okovango
delta
in
search
of
a
cheetah
in
a
similar
pose
.
that
said
,
it
is
possible
that
the
threshold
of
originality
is
very
low
.
for
example
,
in
walter
v
lane
,
reporters
who
transcribed
a
speech
were
held
to
be
authors
of
the
transcription
,
and
owners
of
a
copyright
which
subsisted
in
it
.
essentially
,
by
this
,
arnold
is
arguing
that
whilst
the
subject
matter
of
some
photographs
may
deserve
protection
,
it
is
inappropriate
for
the
law
the
presume
that
the
subject
matter
of
all
photographs
is
deserving
of
protection
.
the
most
famous
plautdietsch
writer
,
arnold
dyck
,
wrote
in
the
molotschna
dialect
,
though
his
origins
were
from
the
old
colony
.
during
his
life
he
made
many
changes
in
his
spelling
system
.
his
developments
are
the
basis
for
the
various
spellings
used
today
.
the
latter
two
claim
to
write
in
the
old
colony
dialect
,
as
seen
in
their
verb
endings
,
while
the
other
three
use
the
plautdietsch
as
spoken
by
the
descenders
of
the
bergthal
colony
,
i.
e.
the
old
colony
dialect
with
a
loss
of

the
most
common
method
employed
by
physicists
to
calculate
the
probability
of
an
atom
ejecting
an
electron
relies
on
"
fermi
's
golden
rule
"
.
although
based
upon
quantum
mechanics
,
the
method
treats
a
light
quantum
as
an
electromagnetic
wave
that
causes
an
atom
and
its
constituent
electrons
to
transition
from
one
energy
state
(
"
eigenstate
"
)
to
another
.
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
the
particle
nature
of
light
can
not
explain
the
dependence
on
polarization
with
regard
to
the
direction
electrons
are
emitted
,
a
phenomenon
that
has
been
considered
useful
in
gathering
polarization
data
from
black
holes
and
neutron
stars
.
nonetheless
,
the
notion
that
the
photoelectric
effect
demonstrates
the
particle
nature
of
light
persists
in
many
introductory
textbooks
.
it
usually
supplements
product
positioning
techniques
like
multi
dimensional
scaling
or
factor
analysis
and
is
used
to
create
ideal
vectors
on
perceptual
maps
.
'
perceptual
map
of
competing
products
with
ideal
vectors
'
starting
with
raw
data
from
surveys
,
researchers
apply
positioning
techniques
to
determine
important
dimensions
and
plot
the
position
of
competing
products
on
these
dimensions
.
like
all
regression
methods
,
the
computer
fits
weights
to
best
predict
data
.
the
resultant
regression
line
is
referred
to
as
an
ideal
vector
because
the
slope
of
the
vector
is
the
ratio
of
the
preferences
for
the
two
dimensions

after
the
war
of
independence
the
strong
position
of
the
army
and
the
lack
of
solid
political
institutions
meant
that
every
peruvian
president
until
1872
held
some
military
rank
.
the
'
ejército
del
perú
'
also
had
a
major
role
in
the
definition
of
national
borders
by
participating
in
several
wars
against
neighbor
countries
.
the
consequent
lack
of
military
preparedness
combined
with
bad
leadership
were
major
causes
of
peru
's
defeat
against
chile
in
the
war
of
the
pacific
(
1879
-
1883
)
.
a
major
turning
point
in
this
process
was
the
arrival
in
1896
of
a
french
military
mission
contracted
by
president
nicolás
de
piérola
.
it
has
been
claimed
that
jessup
's
use
of
a
postcard
in
responding
to
allende
publicized
their
correspondence
.
this
possibility
,
some
theorists
consider
,
was
plausible
cause
for
the
government
to
have
intervened
,
disrupting
the
conversation
by
replacing
allende
with
allen
,
who
was
possibly
a
cia
agent
monitoring
allende
's
inbound
mail
.
this
theory
is
suspect
for
several
reasons
,
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
fact
that
domestic
intelligence
gathering
nor
communications
within
the
united
states
are
within
the
purview
of
the
cia.
more
importantly
,
allende
has
been
accessible
to
the
community
of
"
philadelphia
experiment
"
researchers
for
years
,
discounting
any
intervention
by
the
government

mardi
images
had
been
intended
to
help
pinpoint
exactly
where
the
lander
has
landed
,
and
possibly
help
find
potential
science
targets
.
mardi
was
built
by
malin
space
science
systems
,
and
it
is
the
lightest
and
most
efficient
camera
ever
to
land
on
mars
.
it
would
have
used
only
3
watts
of
power
during
the
imaging
process
,
less
than
most
other
space
cameras
.
it
had
originally
been
designed
and
built
to
perform
the
same
function
on
the
mars
surveyor
2001
lander
mission
;
after
that
mission
was
canceled
,
mardi
spent
several
years
in
storage
until
it
was
deployed
on
the
'
phoenix
'
lander
.
by
the
fall
of
1899
,
development
was
described
as
"
of
the
most
superficial
character
,
"
although
frenzel
had
driven
one
tunnel
18
feet
into
the
rock
.
by
1901
-
1902
,
frenzel
was
excavating
several
thousand
tons
intended
for
shipment
to
europe
.
most
of
the
placerville
ore
was
less
than
3
%
vanadium
,
too
low
grade
to
pay
for
shipment
to
europe
,
so
in
1905
the
vanadium
alloys
co.
built
an
ore
-
processing
mill
southeast
of
placerville
to
recover
the
metal
as
ferro
-
vanadium
,
which
it
sold
.
this
descent
is
most
likely
nothing
more
than
a
legitimizing
fiction
.
the
"
vlachian
"
origin
of
the
brothers
attested
in
the
sources
may
simply
confirm
what
is
already
known
,
that
they
lived
in
moesia
.
this
is
a
likely
option
,
as
large
numbers
of
cumans
had
settled
in
moesia
in
the
12th
century
,
and
continued
to
do
so
in
the
13th
.
if
that
is
correct
,
then
the
nationalist
controversy
becomes
obsolete
,
as
the
cumans
are
an
extinct
people
,
which
is
neither
bulgarian
nor
romanian
,
and
has
intermixed
with
both
.
in

genetics
,
'
muller
's
ratchet
'
(
named
after
hermann
joseph
muller
and
a
mechanical
device
)
is
the
process
by
which
the
genomes
of
an
asexual
population
accumulate
deleterious
mutations
in
an
irreversible
manner
.
this
encyclical
was
written
in
the
wake
of
vatican
ii
,
when
the
catholic
church
was
questioning
and
revising
many
long
-
held
practices
.
priestly
celibacy
is
considered
a
discipline
rather
than
dogma
,
and
some
at
the
time
had
expected
that
it
might
be
relaxed
.
the
encyclical
sacerdotalis
caelibatus
from
24
june
1967
,
confirms
the
traditional
church
teaching
,
that
celibacy
is
an
ideal
state
and
continues
to
be
mandatory
for
roman
catholic
priests
.
however
,
during
his
pontificate
paul
vi
was
considered
generous
in
permitting
bishops
to
grant
laicization
of
priests
who
wanted
to
leave
the
sacerdotal
state
,
a
position
which
was
drastically
reversed
by
john
paul
ii
in
1980
and
cemented
in
the
1983
canon
law
that
only
the
pope
himself
can
in
exceptional
circumstances
grant
laicization
.
it
occurred
in
september
1979
,
when
the
international
press
corps
,
travelling
to
ireland
for
the
visit
of
pope
john
paul
ii
,
told
their
irish
colleagues
that
europe
was
"
awash
"
with
rumours
that
hillery
had
a
mistress
living
with
him
in
Áras
an
uachtaráin
(
the
presidential
residence
)
,
that
he
and
his
wife
were
divorcing
and
he
was
resigning
the
presidency
.
in
reality
,
few
people
had
even
heard
of
the
rumours
.
critics
questioned
why
he
chose
to
comment
on
a
rumour
that
few
outside
media
and
political
circles
had
heard
.
hillery
however
defended
his
action
by
saying
that
it
was
important
to
kill
off
the
story
for
the
good
of
the
presidency
,
rather
than
allow
the
rumour
to
circulate
and
be
accepted
as
"
fact
"
in
the
absence
of
a
denial
.
khuzestan
has
been
a
focus
of
criticism
by
human

groups
.
while
khuzestan
is
not
unique
in
terms
of
its
human
rights
record
,
amnesty
notes
that
often
these
abuses
are
related
to
institutional
discrimination
.
in
its
report
entitled
'

to
address

human
rights
situation
'
published
in
february
2006
,
amnesty
states::'even

the

reportedly

...
land
expropriation
by
the
iranian

is
reportedly
so
widespread
that
it
appears
to
amount
to
a
policy
aimed
at
dispossessing
arabs
of
their
traditional
lands
.
this
is
apparently
part
of
a
strategy
aimed
at
the
forcible
relocation
of
arabs
to
other
areas
while
facilitating
the
transfer
of
non

arabs
into
khuzestan
and
is
linked

as

in
its
most
general
sense
,
the
'
practice
of
law
'
involves
giving
legal
advice
to
clients
,
drafting
legal
documents
for
clients
,
and
representing
clients
in
legal
negotiations
and
court
proceedings
such
as
lawsuits
,
and
is
applied
to
the
professional
services
of
a
lawyer
or
attorney
at
law
,
barrister
,
solicitor
,
or
civil
law
notary
.
however
,
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
overlap
between
the
practice
of
law
and
various
other
professions
where
clients
are
represented
by
agents
.
moreover
,
a
growing
number
of
legal
document
assistants
(
ldas
)
are
offering
services
which
have
traditionally
been
offered
only
by

paralegals
.

where
the

are
asked

of
questions
posed
by
the
software
in
order
to
construct
the
legal
documents
.
it
began
as
a
popular
,
important
conjecture
,
but
is
now
considered
a
theorem
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
awarders
of
the
fields
medal
.
the
claim
concerns
a
space
that
locally
looks
like
ordinary
three
dimensional
space
but
is
connected
,
finite
in
size
,
and
lacks
any
boundary
(
a
closed
3-manifold
)
.
the
poincaré
conjecture
claims
that
if
such
a
space
has
the
additional
property
that
each
loop
in
the
space
can
be
continuously
tightened
to
a
point
,
then
it
is
just
a
three

dimensional
sphere

analogous
result

sometimes
in

the
term

is
misused
to
describe
a
phobia

,
a

an
important
feature
of
paranoid
thinking
is
its
centrality
:
that
the
paranoid
person
perceives
themselves
as
central
figures
in
an
experienced
scenario
which
may
be
either
dangerous
(
persecutory
)
or
self

exalting
(
grandiose
)

interprets
events
which
have
no
reference
to
them
in

directed

many
believe
the
idea

"
originated
in
the
early
1900s
with
cecil
rhodes
,
who
advocated
that
the
british
empire
and
the
united
states
should
jointly
impose
a
federal
world
government
(
with
english
as
the
official
language
)

bring
about

peace

this
,

in

and
the

perhaps
known
to
islamic

as
soon
as
it

influenced
their

the
term
"
dignity
"
is
defined
as
"
the
state
of
being
worthy
of
honour
or
respect
"
.
when
this
concept
is
associated
with
the
adjective
"
human
"
,
it
is
used
to
signify
that
all
human
beings
possess
inherent
worth
and
deserve
unconditional
respect
,
regardless
of
age
,
sex
,
health
status
,
social
or
ethnic
origin
,
political
ideas
,
religion
,
or
criminal
history
.
in
other
words
,
this
respect
is
owed
to
every
individual
by
the
mere
fact
that
he
or
she
is
a
"
member
of
the
human
family
"
.
this
intrinsic
worthiness
is
widely
recognized
by
international
law
as
the
source
of
all
human
rights
.
in

“

even
the

are
satisfied
that

now
take
care

they
are
content
to

the
reflectiveness
of

,
often
gives

this
accentuates
the
curves
of
the

can
also
make

this

a

they
argue
that
the
logic

discourse
is
often
circular
and
internally
inconsistent
,
allowing
for
it
to
be
easily
manipulable

moult
at

annually

usually
after

breeding
season

known
as
the
'

'

this
resulting
covering
of
feathers
,
which
will
last
either
until
the
next
breeding
season
or
until
the
next
annual
moult
,
is
known
as
the
'
basic

many
species
undertake

season
known
as

'

the
resulting

being
known

'

.
the
alternate
plumage
is
often
brighter
than
the
basic

,
for
the
purposes

may
also

trait
models
have
been
criticized
as
being
purely
descriptive
and
offering
little
explanation
of
the
underlying
causes
of
personality
.
eysenck
's
theory
,
however
,
does
propose
biological
mechanisms
as
driving
traits
,
and
modern
behavior
genetics
researchers
have
shown
a
clear
genetic
substrate
to
them
.
another
potential
weakness
of
trait
theories
is
that
they
lead
people
to
accept
oversimplified
classifications
,
or
worse
offer
advice
,
based
on
a
superficial
analysis
of
their
personality
.
finally
,
trait
models
often
underestimate
the
effect
of
specific
situations
on
people
's
behavior
.
there
are
generally
large
distinctions
between
the
two
types
of
offenders
'
characteristics
.
situational
offenders
tend
to
offend
at
times
of
stress
;
have
a
later
onset
of
offending
;
have
fewer
,
often
familial
victims
;
and
have
a
general
preference
for
adult
partners
.
pedophilic
offenders
,
however
,
often
start
offending
at
an
early
age
;
often
have
a
large
number
of
victims
who
are
frequently
extrafamilial
;
are
more
inwardly
driven
to
offend
;
and
have
values
or
beliefs
that
strongly
support
an
offense
lifestyle
.
research
suggests
that
incest
offenders
recidivate
at
approximately
half
the
rate
of
extrafamilial
child
molesters
,
and
one
study
estimated
that
by
the
time
of
entry
to
treatment
,
nonincestuous
pedophiles
who
molest
boys
had
committed
an
average
of
282

based
on
the
evaluation
of
pas
,
courts
in
the
us
have
awarded

custody
to

fathers
.
despite
gardner
claiming
pas
was
generally
accepted
by
the
scholarly
community
and
passed
the
frye
test
in
two
states
,
a
2006
analysis
of
court
cases
involving
pas
and
cited
by
gardner
concluded
that
these
decisions
did
not
set
legal
precedent
,
that
pas
is
viewed
negatively
in
most
legal
scholarship
,
and
that
gardner
's
writings
do
not
support
the
existence
of
pas.
both
held
pas
inadmissible
and
one
case
found
that
pas
failed
the
frye
test
as
the
appropriate
professional
community
did
not
generally
accept
;
this
decision
was
upheld
in
an
appellate
court
.
gardner
listed
fifty
cases
on
his
website
that
he
claimed
set
precedents
that
made
pas
admissible
,
but
none
actually
did
;
forty
six
set
no
precedents
or
did
not
discuss
admissibility
and
the
remaining
four
were
problematic
.
the
most
famous
phuthi
leader
in
the
historical
record
was
the
powerful
chief
moorosi
(
born
in
1795
)
,
who
died
in
unclear
circumstances
on
mount
moorosi
(
sotho
'
thaba
moorosi
'
)
in
1879
,
after
a
protracted
nine
-
month
siege
by
the
british
,
'
boers
'
(
i.e.
afrikaner
)
and
basotho
forces
(
including
the
military
participation
of
the
cape
mounted
riflemen
)
.
this
siege
is
often
referred
to
as
"
moorosi
's
rebellion
"
.
the
issue
that
triggered
the
siege
was
alleged
livestock
theft
in
the
herschel
area
.
in
the
aftermath
of
the
siege
,
phuthi
people
dispersed
widely
over
what
is
contemporary
southern
lesotho
and
the
northern
transkei
region
,
in
order
to
escape
capture
by
the
colonial
powers

it
seems
that
on
the
level
of
the
organ
,
the
leaf
may
be
the
ancestor
of
the
flower
,
or
at
least
some
floral
organs
.
when
we
mutate
some
crucial
genes
involved
in
flower
development
,
we
end
up
with
a
cluster
of
leaf
-
like
structures
.
there
probably
also
exists
an
overall
robust
framework
within
which
the
floral
diversity
has
been
generated
.

,
rumors

surrounded

,
inevitably
created
enemies
for
julius

many
of

accused

this
was
almost
certainly
done
in
order
to
discredit

perhaps
,
in

accusers
were
attacking

canonised
483

more
than
the

'
whether
john
paul
ii
canonised
more
saints
than
all
previous

put
together
is
difficult
to
prove
,
as
the
records

incomplete

missing

,
it

it

were
actually

the

namesake
wild
peas

believed
to
be

'
populism
'
is
the
use
of
discourses
,
ideas
or
policies
which
try
to
appeal
to
"
the
people
"
by
setting
up
a
dichotomy
between
"
the
people
"
and
"
the
elite
"
.
this
populist
appeal
to
"
the
people
"
has
often
been
associated
with
an
emotional
appeal
to
identities
,
including
national
,
class
,
ethnic
and
regional
ones
.
populism
may
involve
either
a
political
philosophy
urging
social
and
political
system
changes
-
as
used
by
various
populist
parties
-
and/or
a
rhetorical
style
,
deployed
by
members
of
the
political
class
competing
for
advantage
within
the
existing
regime
.
today
the
term
"
populism
"
is
often
used
,
especially
outside
academia
,
as
a
vague
,
frequently
pejorative
description
,
whether
to
describe
vote
-
grabbing
measures
and
rhetoric
used
by
mainstream
parties
or
in
connection
with
new
right
-
wing
nationalist
movements
as
well
as
many
left

socialist
movements
in

is
present

the

can
often
be
collected

and
examined
.
depending
on
the
results
of
this
examination
,
complete
drainage
of

may
be
necessary
,
often
requiring

in

if

active

campaign
against

use

term

"
and
on
the
celebration
of
the
holiday
itself
in
western
society
,
particularly
in
the
united

.
contrary
to
popular
belief
,
those
campaigning
against
the
"
censorship
"
of
christmas
include
not
only
christians
,
but
atheists
,
muslims
,
and
jews
,
as
well
.
many
of
these
people
claim
that
there
is
a
concerted
effort
to
remove
any
mention
of
christmas
in
public
advertising
,
government
,
public
schools
,
as
well
as
in
general
conversation
with
strangers
at
christmastime
.
some
also
claim
that
this
perceived
censorship
also
extends
to
easter
and
good
friday
,
where
euphemisms
are
sometimes
used
to
avoid
mentioning
these
holidays
by
name
.

recognizes
christmas
day
as
the
only
federal
holiday
held

he
is
said
to
have
acted
as
a
foil
to
his
commander
's
innovative
strategies
,
by
expertly
formulating
the
orthodox
strategy
.
for
instance
,
according
to
arrian
's
'
anabasis
'
,
at
the
granicus
parmenion
suggested
delay
before
the
attack
,
as
the
army
had
already
marched
all
day
as
well
as
for
other
political
and
geographical
issues
.
this
brought
the
persian
cavalry
onto
the
field
first
against
the
greeks
the
next
morning
,
setting
up
a
defeat
in
detail
,
as
is
reported
in
the
accounts
from
that
time
.
in
any
event
,
the
outcome
may
have
tempered
any
youthful
brashness
on
the
part
of
alexander
,
for
he
proceeded
very
cautiously
the
next
six
months
or
so
,
almost
dawdling
as
he
liberated
greek
cities
in
asia
minor
,
and
that
muting
of
his
aggressiveness
is
more
in
line
with
a
near
defeat
.
a
pigovian
tax
is
considered
one
of
the
"
traditional
"
means
of
bringing
a
modicum
of
market
forces
,
and
thus
better
market
efficiency
,
to
economic
situations
where
externality
problems
exist
.
more
recently
,
particularly
in
the
united
states
since
the
late
1970s
,
and
in
other
developed
nations
since
the
1980s
,
an
alternative
to
pigovian
taxation
has
arisen
:
the
creation
of
a
market
for
"
pollution
rights
.
"
pollution
rights
markets
are
not
generally
more
efficient
than
pigovian
taxes
but
are
often
more
appealing
to
policy
makers
because
giving
out
the
rights
for
free
(
or
at
less
than
market
price
)
allows
polluters
to
lose
less
profits
or
even
gain
profits
(
by
selling
their
rights
)
relative
to
the
unaltered
market
case
.
pollution
rights
markets
are
a
part
of
the
field
of
environmental
economics
generally
,
and

one
interpretation
of
the
anecdote
treats
the
lion
as
a

the

may
also
allude

the
reason

drew
an
estimated
one
million
visitors
over
the
next
several
years
and
was
purchased
by
an
ohio
catholic
revivalism
group
.
a
local
chemist
examined
the
windows
and
suggested
the
stain
was
produced
by
water
deposits
combined
with
weathering
,
yielding
a
chemical
reaction
like
that
often
seen
on
old
bottles
,
perhaps
due
to
the
action
of
the
water
sprinkler
.
images
of
the

also
been
reported
on

some
risk
their
life
to
help
suffering
animals
;
some
defend
these
farms
as
necessary
to
avoid
human
starvation
.
however
,
while
factory
farming
is
necessary
to
produce
the
quantity
of
meat
,
eggs
,
and
dairy
products
currently
demanded
by
consumers
it
is
n't
necesseraly
required
to
produce
the
amounts
of
these
products
required
in
a
healthy
(
plant
based
)
diet
like
the
ones
promoted
by
many
nutrition
experts
.
the
broad
majority
of
experts
believe
that
while
some
form
of
industrial
farming
is
necessary
to
feed
billions
of
humans
,
the
current
methods
must
be
altered
for
a
variety
of
reasons
.
all
other
universes
are
increasingly
distorted
"
shadows
"
of
it
,
ending
finally
at
the
other
extreme
,
chaos
,
which
is
the
complete
negation
of
the
prototype
.
travel
between
these
"
shadow
"
universes
is
only
possible
by
beings
descended
from
the
blood
of
this
pantheon
.
those
"
of
the
blood
"
can
walk
through
shadow
,
imagining
any
possible
reality
and
then
walk
to
it
,
making
their
environment
more
similar
to
their
desire
as
they
go
.
it
is
argued
between
the
characters
whether
these
"
shadows
"
even
exist
before
they
're
imagined
by
a
member
of
the
royal
family
of
amber
,
or
if
the
"
shadows
"
existence
can
be
seen
as
an
act
of
godlike
creation
.
the
orloj
stopped
working
many
times
in
the
centuries
after
1552
,
and
was
repaired
many
times
.
some
speculate
that
the
government
purposely
gouged
out
the
original
maker
's
eyes
in
order
to
prevent
him
from
making
a
similar
clock
for
another
country
.
after
this
he
died
touching
the
clock
,
at
which
point
the
clock
stopped
working
and
remained
unrepairable
for
a
number
of
years
.
in
the
17th
century
moving
statues
were
added
,
and
figures
of
the

were
added
after
major
repair
in

-
1866

more
generally
,
the
series
examines
the
difference
between
greed
and
ambition
.
however
,
as
the
most
wealthy
nations
are
the
only
ones
that
can
develop
space
,
they
are
the
only
ones
who
end
up
reaping
the
benefits
.
similarly
,
the
protagonist
,
hachirota
hoshino
,
initially
wants
to
go
faster
and
farther
than
he
ever
has
before
,
yet
as
a
result
he
nearly
destroys
both
himself
,
and
his
relationships
with
others
.
hachi
's
father
,
goro
hoshino
,
is
also
caught
between
the
two
,
having
spent
many
years
away
from
his
wife
and
children
so
that
he
could
explore
space
.
